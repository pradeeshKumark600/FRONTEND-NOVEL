    subtitle: "Poonsolai Village",
    content: `The trade routes winding through the southern part of Sivaganga district, the lush green lands soaked with sediment, the shadows cast by neem trees swaying like the clear music of the southern breeze… all these together formed Poonsolai.

Even the scent of the wind was different here.
Not just the smell of earth… this was the fragrance of affection.
A scent that moistens the heart with roots, intimacies, and memories.

Poonsolai was indeed a small village. But its uniqueness lay in its greenery, in its ancient glory.
This village, which sprouts green even in summer, transforms into a flowery breeze with the cool southern wind in winter, enchanting human hearts.

There stood a large palatial mansion... the palace of the Venthanar family. When the growing rays of the sun fell as long shadows, that old red brick doorway slowly opened.

Seven feet high, this iron-bound plow door—this was not just a house... it was history itself.

About six and a half acres of land surrounded the palace, with corn and rice stalks swaying in the wind everywhere. Small boulders displaying courage around the front of the house, slanted lush plants on the upper side, rows of coconut trees... everything seemed less like a house and more like a forest.

The three-story wooden structure faced the main entrance. Red curtains danced in the swirling wind through the mid-level windows. Mature coconut trees were planted on both sides. The entire house was filled with architecture reminiscent of ancient cities and traditional sculptures.

From the side of that grand mansion, an ancient golden bell began to ring. That palace of Poonsolai, surrounded by greenery... light slowly began to illuminate the entire house. In the middle of the green garden, as the sun cast its golden light, a fragrant breeze swept from the eastern entrance of the palace.

The sacred prayer room inside the palace—though small, its serenity matched the divinity of a temple. In the center of that room, the daughter-in-law of the house, Mangai, sat with complete devotion in her eyes, lighting a lamp with garland for the sandalwood-adorned Goddess Meenakshi, singing:

"In the land of Madurai, she gained glory
Meenakshi mother, companion of my life!"

Listening to this in rapture, her father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband, and brother-in-law—all four sat in the reception hall.

After the prayer, Mangai showed the ritual lamp to the head of the house, Venthanar, with an auspiciously smiling face. With the subtle pride characteristic of palace dwellers and a raised forehead, he bowed to the lamp with calm dignity.

Next, Venthanar's wife Mangalammal, beside her their eldest son Sathiya Venthan (Mangai's husband), and second son Chandra Venthan touched and worshipped the lamp.

After showing the lamp to everyone, Mangai placed it in the prayer room and walked toward the kitchen to bring tea for everyone.

Before she returned, let us learn about the people in that palace!

The eldest head of the house:

Venthanar and his wife Mangalammal have two sons and one daughter.

Eldest son Sathiya Venthan and his wife Mangai have a son Nandavarman (29), daughter Pavithra (20)

Second son Chandra Venthan and his wife Vasanthi have a son Sarvesh (27), daughter Kavya (20)

Third daughter Prabavathi and her husband Deivavirakash have sons Pragatheesh (27) and Pranav (24). That's all for now—we'll learn about the others as the story unfolds!

Shortly, Mangai came with coffee for everyone, served it to the three of them, and turned to go back to the kitchen to attend to breakfast. She saw a figure standing at the doorway and froze in shock—the tray in Mangai's hands fell to the ground.

At the loud sound of the tray hitting the floor, the three sitting there turned around.

Mangai stood motionless, eyes wide, staring at the doorway. A look they had never seen before... not fear... but... shock! The three of them noticed where her gaze had fixed.

They too, who had been smiling... suddenly stood up.
At the doorway... as the morning sunlight shone, reflecting that light on his face, stood a man.

Seeing him... with such joy
"It's him! He is the eldest heir of this house!" they all stood there, forgetting themselves.

From the kitchen, Chandra Venthan's wife Vasanthi also came out, hearing the commotion in the reception hall.

At that moment, relatives from every room began to wake up and slowly came to the reception hall, seeing them staring at the doorway, everyone went there.

From the moment he stood at the doorway, the entire palace seemed to have frozen.

In that cool breeze mixed with greenery floated a new fragrance... and the taste of an old memory.

With joy sparkling in his eyes, Sathiya Venthan was the first to move. After eight years, seeing his son, he widened his eyes and opened his heart, touched his son's face with two fingers...

"Varma..." he called his son softly.

But he! He stood silent. However, he gave him one look. What did that man see in that look! Immediately, Sathiya Venthan rushed forward and embraced his son.

As his hand embraced his son, something that had been lacking for so many years was filled, his heart told him, but he couldn't understand what it was.

At the same time, standing a little behind him, a heart began to beat rapidly.

With trembling legs, Mangai came near her son. Tears prevented words from forming. She looked at her son's face... the face she had seen only in photographs for eight years. But now it stood alive before her. Was it real? That mother's heart beat rapidly as she gently touched his cheek with her finger and caressed it, saying "Varma... Varma... is this... a dream...?" Realizing he was standing there, both her hands grabbed him and broke into sobs.
Like an evening downpour, as if the tunnels of the mind had opened.

The melody of that cry echoed soundlessly throughout the palace.

Everyone else stood watching that scene.

In that crowd, only one person's gaze changed. Venthanar,
The eldest head of that house.

He didn't move... standing at a distance, he observed his grandson very intensely.

There was no anger on his face. But there was another kind of turmoil. His gaze seemed as if he was seeing everyone there as a stranger and noticing each person for the first time.

The sharpness in his gaze...
A fire at the corner of his eyes...
For a moment, his body trembled.

"This look... I've seen this before... is he really my grandson?" his mind began to draw many lines.

The others standing at the doorway
Chandra Venthan, Vasanthi, Sarvesh, Pavithra, Kavya, Prabavathi, Deivavirakash, Pragatheesh, Pranav—everyone stood together, wordless, merely as spectators.

Among them, only Sarvesh asked Pragatheesh in doubt, softly so only he could hear, "Is this our Varma?"

"Why are you asking like that?" said Pragatheesh.

"His face looks like our Varman... but something seems different about him..." he said.

"Just keep quiet for a while! You're babbling nonsense," he silenced him and began to observe what was happening.

As people came to him one by one to speak, without speaking a single word, he just stood there keenly observing all the faces and didn't say a word.

When everyone noticed that he remained silent like that, while everyone was in different mental states, Venthanar's voice rang out at that palace entrance to break the tension.

"How long are you going to keep him standing there? Bring him inside," he said.

Following his words, when Mangai gently said to bring Nandavarman inside, "Come in, Varma," she said with a smiling face.

At that moment... from behind Varman, a five-year-old girl's voice called out "Daddy."

That word... the sound of peace that had been flowing in that house shattered the next instant like a stone falling into water.

Mangai's face, which had been blooming with a smile, became empty in an instant.

Everyone's eyes there searched for who owned that voice. A girl child of about 5 years old slowly came from behind her father and stood near him with a smile,
"Daddy... should I come too?... with you," she asked, holding Varman's hand and coaxing.

"Okay, dear, let's go inside, come," Varman picked up his daughter with a small smile and entered inside that palace.

Everyone couldn't understand for a moment what was happening. The man who had listened to everyone in Varman's family talk all this time without speaking a single word, now entered with a smile as soon as that child spoke—everyone was shocked to see this.

Sathiya Venthan just stood there... not a word.

Varman didn't even say the words "She is my daughter." But the "Daddy..." that came from that child's mouth...
That was enough for everyone to understand who she was.

Everyone there stood at the doorway watching Varman go inside the house. The one who went inside turned toward them and told his father, "Father, tell Marudhu to bring all our luggage and keep it in my room," and left from there. But in the word "Father" that he called, everyone froze in that same place.

The head of that palace, Venthanar, watched the departing Varman and became even more confused.

At the same time, in the palace... at a distance, in a corner of that same Poonsolai, an old bicycle leaned against a rope-tied post. That place had hidden traces of emotions unknown to others. An old man sitting there laughed heartily and said, "This is just the beginning, Venthanar," and laughed.

This was not just a Poonsolai village... this was the beginning of a story. Not just a family's tradition, but the secrets of many generations were buried within its walls.

    subtitle: "Chapter 2",
    content: `Varman brought his daughter to the room, and for a moment his sharp eyes measured that room.
Yathra, who slowly looked around the room, asked her father questions with childlike wonder, and Varman patiently told her one by one.

That house was a new world for her. Even though she had been abroad for so many years, somehow she liked this house very much the moment she saw it. So she started looking at every place without missing a spot, holding her father's hand. When signs of sleepiness appeared in her eyes within a few minutes, her father, understanding this, gently patted her, and she leaned on his chest and fell asleep within seconds...Yathra...!

He gently laid her on the bed, gave an affectionate kiss on the child's forehead without disturbing her sleep. Taking his phone, he went to the balcony in that room.

Coming to the balcony, he took his phone and called someone.

When the phone was answered from the other side, Varman asked, "Did you inquire about the person I told you about or not?"

"I've sent all the details about them to your email. Check it. Not only that, the person you mentioned has booked tickets to come to India this coming Sunday," he said as additional information.

Hearing that news, as Nandavarman hung up the phone, a villainous smile bloomed on his face.

"I was also expecting you to come to India soon," he said in an angry voice.

After standing on that balcony for a while looking out at the garden, he realized it was getting late and entered the room again.

When Varman entered the room, seeing his daughter Yathra sleeping like an angel, he revealed a charming smile—only he knows what's in his mind.

While this was happening upstairs, downstairs... Varman's mother told her husband, "What sin did we commit, that our own son got married without even telling us," and cried.

Sathiya Venthan, unable to give any answer, hugged his wife and consoled her, thinking inwardly about how his son's appearance and speech had completely changed, while everyone in the family stood silently around them. Venthanar broke that silence.

"Why this crying! Whether you have faith in your son or not! But I have full faith in my heir. My grandson will never act in a way that brings shame to this grandfather. So stop crying,
After so many years, my grandson has come home. Arrange a feast that will astonish him
We can talk about everything else later..." he told his daughter-in-law.

"Sathya, Chandra... I need to talk to you a bit. Come with me." He took both his sons with him today.

As soon as the three entered the room, Venthanar looked directly at Sathya Venthan and asked, "Do you understand anything, Sathya?"

Without hesitation, Sathiya Venthan said, "Father... I have complete faith in my son.
He definitely wouldn't have done anything wrong. I firmly believe that!"

Hearing what his son said, Venthanar smiled gently, looked carefully at both his sons, and told them certain things that shocked both of them.

"Father... what are you saying?"
Chandra Venthan asked, stuttering.

"What I'm saying is true..."
he nodded slowly.

Hearing that, even his eldest son's eyes welled up a little. When he came to ask his father something, his father interrupted him, "For whatever reason...
Until my grandson tells the truth...
No one in this house should tell anyone about this!" he said and left that room.

As soon as he left the room, both happiness and worry appeared simultaneously on the faces of the brothers, and they hugged each other, expressed their joy, and left that room.

(When Nandavarman was eight years old, unexpectedly, the death of his twin brother Maravarman occurred by his own hand.

In that shock, Nandavarman remained unconscious for a week, and he had forgotten that such an event had even happened.

Though this was somewhat frightening for those in the house, the good thing about it was that he didn't ask about his brother Maran.

Thinking that if he stayed in this town, people here would tell him about it and make him sad, his family members admitted him to a hostel and arranged everything there, including school and college.

After finishing college, when he came to his hometown, everything went well for a few days. Then during an auspicious event at home, some people deliberately spoke about him being the killer of his brother and told him everything, deeply hurting his heart. When he asked his parents if all this was true and learned that everything was indeed true, his heart ached wounded. With guilt that he had killed his own twin brother by his own hand, despite the deceased trying to stop him, saying "I won't stay here," he left for abroad. Nandavarman was 22 years old when he left this town. After all these years, he has just now come to his hometown. Let's see what's in the mind of the one who has come!)

At the same time, Madurai city,
The city of Madurai, spread out as the heart of the south, stood upright carrying an ancient beauty that captivates the mind at first sight. Chariot streets passing through temple corridors, sunlight touching temple flagpoles, pure streets, temple bell sounds—all these were mixed together in the green corners of the city.

In one of the central areas of this city, a two-story house spread out neatly. The exterior shone like a white ground, with vines around the reception door, flower garlands, beautiful rangoli at the house entrance, and pillars with bouquets in the inner entrance—seeing all these, one could immediately know that there was a celebration in that house today. Yes, the engagement of the eldest heir of this house, our heroine, was being fixed today.

From beautiful sleep, eyes slowly opened, her pure complexion, her appearance filled with natural beauty—as Lord Surya entered that room with morning greetings, in that light our heroine Mitra Yazhini shone like a moon-drenched angel.

The heroine's family
Father Annadurai, mother Lakshmi, our heroine Mitra Yazhini, younger sister Thanuja, younger brother Roshan—these are the heroine's family members.

The heroine's father owns a large department store in the city. While mother Lakshmi takes care of the home, the heroine happily does her favorite profession of teaching. Mitra's younger sister is studying in her third year of college. Her younger brother is studying in his first year of college. Mitra's soul friend Durga works in Mitra's father's store. That's all—we can learn about the others as the story progresses.

Today she has her engagement, and in another week, her wedding, so she had taken a few days off from school and slept for a long time, our heroine.

Hearing the noise of relatives downstairs reaching her room, thinking it wouldn't be good to stay in her room any longer, she entered the bathroom and soon got ready to go down after bathing.

She braided her long hair luxuriously, and the white jasmine flowers adorning it added more beauty to her dark serpentine hair. With every movement, the gentle waves of jasmine announced her beauty.
With the wet glow of having just bathed, her crystal body became more polished, glittering like a diamond shining in sunlight. The beautiful shawl she wore showed off her slender waist even more prominently, revealing all her limbs like a sculpted statue. Her eyes like lotus petals sparkled with a magnetic gaze that could enchant anyone. The gentle smile on her rose petal-like lips added more polish to her complete beauty. As she slowly descended like a beauty statue, the wind, enchanted by her beauty, embraced and gently caressed her body. All eyes that saw her stood amazed, wondering if she was a goddess or an art painting. It must be said that everyone who saw the scene of her coming like a beauty goddess froze for a moment. While everyone stood entranced, an aunt of hers approached Mitra, warded off the evil eye, and said, "Only after the bride came down does this house feel like it has wedding festivities," making the place lively.

Another person held Mitra's hand and said, "I'm sad now that I don't have another face. If only I had another son, I would have asked him to snatch you away. You look so magnificent," and lovingly pinched her cheek.

Watching this, Thanuja's face, coming from her room, clearly showed envy. Still, hiding it, she said, "What are you saying? Won't you accept me as your daughter-in-law at all! Will you only ask to snatch away my sister?" and came to that place talking.

Hearing that, the woman said, "Girl, you don't suit my house. What will I do taking a chatterbox like you? Your sister is the one suitable for my family, modest and graceful," she replied outrageously to her question.

Hearing that, everyone there laughed loudly, and angry at her sister even for that, she moved away from that place. Otherwise, she would have to openly show her anger at her sister, she thought, and left from there.

Since the engagement was in the evening, relatives were coming one by one, and the reception hall was filled with family members and became lively within a few minutes. Mitra sat on the sofa with a smile, watching them all.

Then her father came near. He sat gently near her. Looking at her face silently for a moment, then
"Mitra... do you really... truly consent to this marriage, dear?" he asked gently.

Mitra, with a small smile
"Father... how many times will you ask... I fully consent to this marriage, Father," she said.

Her mother Lakshmi, who heard that conversation from a few steps away, came from the kitchen.

"Why do you keep asking her 'consent, consent' whenever you see her? Our daughter herself said she'll marry the boy we chose, so what doubt do you have after that?" she asked with some sternness.

Without answering his wife's question, to her husband sitting silently, "They forgot to buy banana leaves, you go and buy them," she sent her husband away and gave Mitra a smile before going to the kitchen.

Though everything was going smoothly, only Mitra's mind was not at peace. She knows how much affection her father has for her.
But for the past few days, it seemed to Mitra that along with affection in his gaze, there was also a kind of guilt. Though it was slightly irritating, she let it go without thinking more. Poor thing, if only she had thought more about that irritation then...
Would she have avoided hearing words that would hurt her later? Who knows? Fate spares no one.

    content: `Evening approached.
Every corner of that house had become lively. Some women took Mitra to the room and adorned her with joy-filled excitement.

At the same time, in the room where Thanuja stayed, along with her friends, she was applying makeup to herself to the point of drowning. Somehow, today she had to surpass Mitra and make herself registered in the viewers' eyes, and her friends were also helping her to do so.

At five o'clock in the evening, the gift amounts brought by the groom's family filled all the tables. Various fruit plates, gold bangles, silk sarees—each one proclaimed the wealth and prosperity of that family.

Groom Madhesh, his father Parantaman, mother Chintamani.

At the auspicious time, Mitra, called by the family, slowly descended from her upstairs room. While some women came forward to stand beside her, at that time Thanuja, saying she would stand beside her sister, stood beside Mitra showing off the painted face she had been applying all this time.

Seeing Mitra coming down, Parantaman, Chintamani, and all the relatives praised her beauty and said she was a perfect match for Madhesh. Seeing this, Madhesh's mother had such a smile on her face. Because wasn't she the girl she had seen? Yes, Mitra was the girl chosen by Madhesh's mother Chintamani.

Having seen and befriended Mitra every Tuesday at the Murugan temple weekly, she gradually talked to her husband to make her her daughter-in-law and now had arranged even the engagement.

The Mitra-Madhesh engagement papers were read.
"Their marriage will take place next Wednesday, that is, on the fifth, on Krishna Saptami," the priest confirmed, and the elders from both families exchanged ceremonial betel leaves.

Then Mitra and Madhesh—both exchanged rings with the blessings of the elders.

There was joy on the girl's face. But the groom, without even looking at the girl's face, reluctantly put on the ring.

Like him, Mitra's father Durai (Annadurai)...
Standing in a corner by the stage, was watching his daughter's figure motionlessly.

There was no joy on his face.
What appeared in his eyes was only emptiness... truths trapped in his mind that he couldn't escape. Unable to tell it to his daughter and unable to stay normal keeping it in his mind, he was struggling.

Whether anyone noticed both their faces or not! Mitra had been noticing.

When exchanging rings, just as every girl feels inside that she wants the groom to look at her with desire, Mitra felt the same and looked up at him. Seeing that he put on the ring reluctantly without even wanting to look at her face, she noticed, what to do? This is the time telling her through their actions that they don't like her. Though one mind said it seemed wrong, another mind said no, it won't be that wrong, it just seems that way to our mind, and a voice in her mind prevented her from thinking more about it. Like that, though one mind of Mitra said it seemed wrong, another mind confused her saying it wouldn't be like that and didn't let her think more.

Mitra-Madhesh engagement ended sweetly. In another week, the wedding.

After exchanging the engagement rings, Mitra's mother
"Thanuja... take the groom and sister to eat," she said.

Thanuja, with a smile on her face,
"Come, brother-in-law..." she said, held Madhesh's hand, and took him to the eating area. Mitra followed behind, watching Madhesh's hand joined with her sister's.

At the food serving area,
Thanuja asked both of them,
"What will you eat? Sambar or more kuzhambu?"
She asked each one and served them on the plate.

Watching from a distance, "Did you see, Samandhi? How responsible my younger daughter is," Mitra's mother praised Thanuja to Madhesh's mother.

Who knows what smoke there is in that praise?

At the same time, in Poonsolai village, when everyone sat at the eating place for dinner, Varman and his daughter Yathra alone hadn't come to serve food yet. Noting this, Venthanar told his granddaughter Pavithra and asked her to call them.

In Varman's room, father and daughter, who had just woken up well from journey fatigue, were cleaning themselves and coming down when they opened the door, Pavithra stood before them.

"Brother! Grandfather asked you and baby to come down to eat," she said only that and left from there without looking up at both their faces.

She was a little angry that "Brother got married without even telling anyone."

Carrying Yathra, the one who came down set his daughter down and made her sit beside him after sitting on the chair there. When he said no, she went to her grandmother.

Yathra went to her grandmother Mangai and asked,
"Grandma, what did you make for me to eat?" with interest.

As soon as she heard the word "Grandma" in that small voice,
Dew drops fell in Mangai's eyes.

With tears in her eyes and joy on her face, Mangai embraced and lifted her granddaughter. "My dear..." she said and kissed all over her face and pampered her.

Varman was watching that without any emotion. No one else can say what he's thinking in his mind except him.

Yathra spoke not only with Mangai but with everyone there, and not only that, she called them knowing what their relationship was—that was the wonder for everyone there.

When that child spoke with everyone, the sound of her laughter echoed throughout all places in that palace. It felt like life had come to that palace only now.

Sathiya Venthan, who had been watching his granddaughter's laughter all this time, "Come here to grandfather, dear," he called affectionately, lifted his granddaughter on his lap, and fed her food from his plate. Yathra also took the food her grandfather fed without any refusal.

While feeding her food, he asked his granddaughter, "How do you already know all of us, dear?"

"I've seen all of you in photos, grandfather. Daddy showed me all your photos and told me how to call you all..." she said.

Hearing that answer, Sathiya Venthan said,
"Never mind... when he got married, he forgot us. But he didn't forget us with you, he told you about us... that much is happiness..." the pain in his words was known to everyone there.

Again to his granddaughter
"Only you and your father came to the town... where is your mother, dear?" After he asked, only then did that question arise in the minds of others there too.

At that question, Yathra...
Looked at her father.
But thinking that they won't give him food if he notices what's happening there, or for some reason, he had taken food himself and was eating.

Seeing her father eating silently, Yathra thought, "How can you eat peacefully? How will I let you?" and gave an answer no one expected to the question Sathiya Venthan asked.

"Grandfather... Mother and Father had a very big fight... Father hit Mother... so Mother angrily left me and Father and went away," she said sadly.

Hearing those words from that child's mouth... the dining table became silent for a moment.

Not only that, Grandfather, "Mother treats me with great affection... but Mother won't let Father talk to me..." she said sadly.

(The child, not knowing fully about her mother, says this based only on what she saw. The child who has seen only one face of her mother and has immense affection for her—that affection will stir up what all... who knows?)

Hearing what Yathra said, Venthanar angrily asked, "What is this, Varma? What is your daughter saying?"

The one who had been silent all this time now stopped eating and answered his question with some coldness, "I need to talk to you alone."

Understanding why Varman was talking to him like this, grandfather also stopped eating, gave Varman one look, and went to his room from there.

But our hero, as if born only to eat, ate everything his mother cooked without missing anything, and then Varman went into his grandfather's room.

As soon as Varman went inside, the one who had been silent all this time, his younger brother Sarvesh, immediately approached his brother's daughter. "Hi, I am Sarvesh," he introduced himself, extending his hand to the child. The child looked at him up and down.

Seeing this, Pranav laughed and said, "Even that child somehow knows what you're like. It's looking at you strangely even though you extended your hand. Why do you bring shame to our family like this?" and laughed.

Looking at poor Yathra, the child said! "Why are you laughing? I didn't look at him wrongly. Should I call him uncle even though he's my uncle? Or should I call him chocolate boy?" she was wondering. You're looking at him and laughing, bad boy," Yathra scolded Pranav.

Hearing that, all the youngsters laughed. Sathiya Devan called Pavithra and asked her to take the child outside and feed her, sending all the youngsters away.

After everyone left, Mangai told her husband, "I'm scared seeing what our granddaughter says."

"Mangai, father went to talk, didn't he? He'll come and tell us. Until then, be calm," he subdued his wife.

After Varman went into his grandfather's room, an hour passed and neither of them came out. Those outside were watching anxiously, not knowing what was happening inside.

What would they talk about for a whole hour?

    subtitle: "Chapter 4",
    content: `More than an hour passed, and Varma was still talking with his father.

Sarvesh and Pranav were playing with that child there.

Truly, seeing that, for some unknown reason, Sathiya Devan couldn't stop thinking about his elder son Varma.

He was finding out just like a child.

So Mangai asked her husband, "Won't you ask our children?" Sarvesh told his mother, "Mother, don't ask that... Just the news that Varman brother has come, grandfather, who hasn't talked about anything for so long, has been talking with our brother for an hour now... so after the day brother left, today grandfather is doing well. If we ask grandfather in that good mental state, what will happen... so let's ask after grandfather and brother finish talking and come," he said.

The mother also understood that and became silent and left. The child, without knowing their talks, was running around... time was passing just watching that.

After that, more than two hours passed, and Varman was still talking with his father and coming out of that room.

After that, Varman, who came out, searched for "Where is Yathra?" for his child.

The child was playing with Pranav and Sarvesh... as soon as he came, the child ran toward him to hug him. Varman, carrying that child, turned to his father and said, "I'm leaving."

"Now? Stay a little longer, Varma. You came after so many days, it's difficult..." said Pranav's mother Pavithra.

To that, Varman said, "I have an important administrative meeting at the office tomorrow. I have to finish a file for that too. I need to finish that too. There's no other time. Otherwise, I would have taken a week off and come... that's why I have to leave now..." Varman gave an explanation.

"Okay, Varma... after going to office tomorrow, don't struggle too much... don't think there's no one in our house anymore. We're nearby..." they bid him farewell.

But all the other people had enmity or anger toward Varma, so none of them looked at Varman properly.

They didn't bid him farewell.

When Varman, carrying that child, was about to leave from here, Sarvesh stopped him. "Varma... forgive me, brother... please, what did that girl say... don't you know... you hit mother, bro? And also, I want to know what problem there was between you and your wife... that's why I'm asking... please don't take it angrily," he asked his brother honestly.

To his brother who asked like this, Varman said, "I'll tell you about that someday, Sarvesh. But now I have to go. Tomorrow morning I have to go to a very important meeting. That's why I'm leaving..." saying that, Varman was leaving.

At that time, Sarvesh asked his own brother, "Brother... you say you'll tell Sarvesh... is your son more important to you than us?" he asked.

"Ah... is he more important... right..." Varman replied sarcastically.

Seeing that, Sathiya Devan angrily said, "Varma, we raised you to keep you in the house and as a disciplined person. That's why, no matter what kind of person you are... but don't scold your wife... we won't even scold our sons-in-law normally. Even if our daughter got tainted... but what did you do to her, Varma..." he scolded angrily.

At that question, Varman looked at his daughter... that child was holding him tightly.

Since they were focused on scolding him, their gaze didn't go to the child at all.

That look was unbearable for Varman.

But like most men in the country, because he was male, the one who suppressed everything inside without becoming emotional remained silent.

Venthanar looked at Sathiya Devan and said, "Sathiya, okay, okay... don't get angry... Varma, go and come... come back..." and sent his grandson.

Varman also silently, carrying his daughter, walked away from there.

I followed my brother.

Seeing him suppress every emotion inside and go silently, my heart felt heavy.

He took the car. I stopped him again and called "Varma, two minutes."

Hearing that, he stopped there and looked at me.

I went there and said, "Brother, what is this like this? This child says in our house how we should raise children well, we raised them looking after. Hearing what this child says, what happened..." I asked.

Varman there said, "Father, I can't say anything. If you say something, I'm afraid I'll ruin our family in a situation I can't believe... that's why I'm saying," he says.

Hearing that, I said, "What happened then, Varma... did your wife really leave you?" I asked.

But to the question I asked, he replied, "What should I say... come and go." When he replied, I couldn't let it go.

    content: `That night, the entire Poonsolai village was calm. But only in the Venthanar family was there great commotion.

Sathiya Devan asked his father, "Father, I still don't understand. Why did Varma behave like this? What's the problem between him and his wife?"

Venthanar let out a deep sigh. "Sathiya, just knowing things from outside isn't enough. We have to know the truth inside before making a decision."

"But Father, did you hear what that girl said? Father hit mother. Isn't this very wrong?" Sarvesh interrupted.

"It's wrong, Sarvesh. But without knowing what happened before that, how can we pass judgment?" Venthanar replied.

Then Mangai came and said, "Should our granddaughter stay with us? The child will get proper care."

"That's Varma's decision. He has to decide," Venthanar said firmly.

The next morning, Varman attended a meeting at his office. But his mind wasn't there. His entire memory was revolving around yesterday's events.

When the meeting ended and he came to his room, his secretary brought a file. "Sir, documents related to this case."

Varman looked at that file. It was a divorce case. A storm hit his mind.

"Let someone else handle this. I don't want it," he said.

"But sir, it's been assigned to you. The senior partner said it's a very important case," the secretary explained.

Varman thought for a moment and said, "Okay, keep it. I'll look at it."

After she left, Varman put his head on his desk and sank into deep thought. His wife, his child, his family—everything was revolving in his mind.

Then his phone rang. It was his grandfather Venthanar.

"Varma, if you're free now, can you meet me once?" Venthanar asked.

"Grandfather, I still have some work. Can I come tomorrow?" Varman asked.

"Varma, this is very important. I need to talk about your wife and child. Please, come today itself," Venthanar insisted.

Varman thought for a moment. "Okay, Grandfather, I'll come at 6 PM," he said and put down the phone.

That evening, Varman went to his grandfather's house. Only Venthanar was in the house.

"Sit, Varma," Venthanar said.

Varman sat down. "What is it, Grandfather?"

"Varma, if I ask you, will you tell me the truth?" Venthanar asked.

"Grandfather..." Varman hesitated.

"Varma, I'm your grandfather. I'm asking for your good. Did your wife really leave you? What's the problem between you two?" Venthanar asked directly.

Varman bowed his head. Tears welled up in his eyes.

"Grandfather... I can't say," his voice trembled.

"Why, Varma? Don't you trust me?" Venthanar asked with affection.

"I trust you, Grandfather. But... I don't know what you'll think if I say this," Varman said.

"Varma, look at me," Venthanar held his shoulders and turned him toward himself. "You're my grandson. My blood. Whatever problem you have, I'll be on your side. Now tell me, what happened?"

Varman took a deep breath. "Grandfather... my wife... she..." he stopped.

"What, Varma? Speak," Venthanar encouraged.

"She deceived me, Grandfather," Varman finally said the truth.

Venthanar was shocked. "What are you saying, Varma?"

"Yes, Grandfather. She was with someone else... when I was busy at the office..." Varman struggled to breathe.

"Is that so? How do you know? Do you have evidence?" Venthanar asked.

"There is, Grandfather. I saw it with my own eyes," Varman said.

"Then what did you do?" Venthanar asked.

"I, in anger... her..." Varman stopped.

"Did you hit her?" Venthanar asked.

Varman nodded. "Yes, Grandfather. I made a mistake. But in that anger... I couldn't control myself."

"Then?" Venthanar asked.

"She left me. She left only Yathra with me and went. I don't even know where she is," Varman said.

Venthanar was silent. After a few moments, "Varma, do you truly believe there's fault in her?" he asked.

"I saw it with my own eyes, Grandfather," Varman said firmly.

    content: `Everyone in the Venthanar family had been tense since this morning. The truth Varman told his grandfather last night had shocked everyone.

Venthanar called his son Sathiya Devan as soon as he woke up in the morning. "Sathiya, today we all need to talk together."

"What's the matter, Father?" Sathiya Devan asked.

"About Varma. About his problem. Call everyone," Venthanar said.

Soon, the entire family gathered in the hall. Sathiya Devan, his wife Mangai, their sons Pranav and Sarvesh, Pavithra—everyone sat around Venthanar.

"Grandfather, what's the matter?" Pranav asked.

Venthanar looked at his family members. "Yesterday Varma told me everything. About his wife's matter."

"What did he say, Father?" Sathiya Devan asked eagerly.

"His wife deceived him. With someone else..." Venthanar began to say.

"What!" Mangai exclaimed in shock. "Is this true?"

"Varma said so. He saw it with his own eyes," Venthanar explained.

"That's why he hit her?" Sarvesh asked.

"Yes. He lost control in anger and hit her. That's why she left him," Venthanar said.

There was silence for a moment. Then Sathiya Devan began to speak. "Father, how do we know what's true in this? Varma says one thing. We don't know what his wife will say."

"That's what I thought too, Sathiya. That's why we need to find her too. We have to hear both sides before making a decision," Venthanar said.

"But where is she? Even Varma doesn't know," Mangai asked.

"That's why we need to find her. Sarvesh, Pranav, you two go and find out. Inquire at her parents' house, friends, everywhere," Venthanar ordered.

"Okay, Grandfather," both brothers said together.

"Father, should we tell Varma about all this?" Sathiya Devan asked.

"No. He's already under great stress. We can tell him after we find out," Venthanar said.

Then a small footstep sound was heard. Everyone turned and looked. There stood little Yathra, tears in her eyes.

"Yathra!" Mangai rushed and picked up the child. "Why are you crying, dear?"

"Grandma... I want mother. Where is mother?" the child asked.

Everyone's heart trembled. What answer to give to this small child?

Venthanar called that child near him. "Yathra, your mother will come in a few days. Until then, you stay with us, okay?"

"When will she come, Grandfather?" the child asked innocently.

"Soon, dear. If you're a good girl, your mother will come quickly," Venthanar said affectionately.

The child slowly nodded. But no one could hide the sadness in her eyes.

That evening, Pranav and Sarvesh went to Varman's wife's parents' house. There, Varman's father-in-law received them.

"Who are you?" he asked.

"Uncle, we're Varma's brothers. We came to see our sister-in-law," Sarvesh said.

The father-in-law's face hardened. "She's not here. I know what your brother did. Don't look for her."

"But uncle, we need to talk a bit. Please," Pranav pleaded.

"Go. Don't want here," the father-in-law tried to close the door.

Then a woman's voice was heard. "Father, who is it?"

That was Varman's wife's voice. Sarvesh spoke quickly. "Sister-in-law, we're Varma's brothers. We need to see you for a bit."

"I don't want to see anyone. Go," she said sternly.

"Sister-in-law, please. For Yathra's sake. For your child's sake," Pranav said.

"Is Yathra okay?" worry was evident in her voice.

"Yes, sister-in-law. But she misses you a lot. Please, can we talk for a bit?" Sarvesh asked.

A moment of silence. Then the door opened. There stood Varman's wife. Her eyes were red, her face had faded.

"What do you want to talk about?" she asked.

"Can we come inside?" Pranav asked.

She hesitated. Then nodded. They went inside.

"Sister-in-law, we came to find out the truth. Varma said you... him..." Sarvesh began.

"I deceived him?" she laughed. But it was a bitter laugh. "He'll think that. But the truth is different."

"What's the truth, sister-in-law?" Pranav asked.

She took a deep breath. "I'll tell you. But will you believe me?"

    subtitle: "The Weight of Truth",
    content: `Annadurai's heart was troubled. He sensed that his daughter's sharp gaze had pierced through him, and that she had understood everything just by looking at his face. "Should I tell her the truth now? Or should I keep hiding it, even though it will destroy the little happiness she has left?" The struggle raged in his mind.

Mitra noticed the pain in his eyes. Yet, with determination to know the truth today no matter what, she kept staring at her father.

Seeing his daughter looking at him with such resolve, Annadurai decided that he could no longer keep it hidden. 'Let whatever happens happen. Let all the suffering that must come, come today and be done with,' he thought. Just as he was about to open his mouth, "Mitra!" Lakshmi's voice called out as she came to that place.

Seeing Lakshmi coming quickly, Annadurai stopped what he was about to say and looked at his wife with anxiety.

There was a certain hardness in his eyes. Lakshmi threatened her husband with her eyes alone. She made a gesture to her husband that seemed to say, 'If you open your mouth, the consequences will be severe.'

Turning to Mitra, Lakshmi said with a smile covering her entire face, "Oh my! As the wedding approaches, my daughter's face keeps getting more beautiful! She's glowing like the moon, my daughter. I'm so happy just looking at her," she said in a coaxing voice.

Affection overflowed in her voice. But only Mitra's father knew that it was all an act.

Mitra heard her mother's affectionate words and smiled slightly. Her mind, which had been troubled and somewhat heavy with various thoughts until now, seemed to melt a little in her mother's love.

Lakshmi stroked Mitra's cheeks and asked, "What's wrong, Mitra? Why do you look like this?"

Just as she was starting to say "Nothing, Mother, it's about Mathesh—", Lakshmi stopped her from speaking.

"Are you asking about the groom Mathesh? The groom is golden, Mitra. He's perfect for your character and beauty. Even if we had searched ourselves, we wouldn't have found such a groom for you. He came looking for you on his own, didn't he? I'm very happy, Mitra. Just watch—after the wedding, everyone who comes will be amazed seeing you both together as a couple," Lakshmi said with some hidden meaning. But Mitra didn't understand it. She just sat listening to everything her mother said with a smile.

"Why are you sitting so quietly? The groom is very good, and that's why we're going to marry our daughter to him," she asked her husband.

He too forced a smile on his face and nodded his head as if saying yes.

"The groom's mother was saying that he doesn't talk much. Apparently, he doesn't talk much with anyone—seems to be very shy. Even during the engagement, she said the groom didn't talk to you and felt sorry about it," Lakshmi said, as if reading the doubt in Mitra's mind, speaking to enchant her.

Lakshmi's beautiful performance made Mitra forget the questions in her mind in a second.

"Mother and Father are happy about this wedding. Is Father sad because I'm getting married and leaving this house? Is that it?" she asked herself the question and answered it herself. 'Mother and everyone in the house are happy thinking about this wedding. I'm the one who's been confused thinking various things. He must just be shy like Mother said. Everything will be fine after the wedding,' she consoled her mind.

She completely forgot all the questions she had come to ask her father. She came to the decision that she could go ahead with her marriage for the family's happiness.

That's exactly what Lakshmi wanted. Annadurai looked at his wife and sighed deeply. The burden on his heart was heavier than before. If she had come a little late, his burden would have been lifted today.

While the three of them were talking, "Sister!" a voice was heard from the doorway.

At that voice, all three were startled and turned in the direction of the voice. There stood Valavan, Lakshmi's younger brother, a sturdy dark-complexioned man with a thick beard on his face, aged thirty-two.

As soon as they saw him, different emotions came and went on all three faces.

Mitra looked at Valavan with no expression, with an emotionless face. It was unclear whether her gaze reflected past events or was merely empty.

Her father Annadurai frowned in anger as soon as he saw Valavan. His eyes reddened, looking at him with a kind of disgust. Those eyes looked at him as if looking at a criminal.

But only Lakshmi's face bloomed with joy. Her eyes welling up, "Valava! Come inside," she called him in with affection.

Valavan clearly read the emotions that came and went on everyone's faces when they saw him. Mitra's emotionless gaze, Annadurai's anger, and his sister's affection created a kind of tension in Valavan's mind, and he entered the house with a somewhat tense face.

"Hey Valava! How are you? How many years has it been since I saw you!" Lakshmi grabbed his hands and asked with tears welling up in her eyes.

Hearing her words, Annadurai's patience ran out. "Enough! Stop it, Lakshmi!" he shouted angrily. "Is he coming back from working abroad? He went to jail for murder! And you're going to ask after his welfare? First, tell him to leave my house!" he shouted angrily.

Though his uncle's words hurt him, Valavan didn't show it on his face. The pain those words caused was buried deep in his mind, which his silence revealed.

"Why are you talking like this? He's my only brother! He came for our Mitra's wedding! And you're talking to him like this?" Lakshmi angrily looked at her husband.

"I don't care what you say—he shouldn't be in this house," said Turai.

"Are you trying to send my brother away? Then you won't see me alive after that!" Lakshmi didn't threaten her husband. But the determination visible in her eyes clearly conveyed the threat behind those words.

Annadurai understood that pressure and looked at his wife, startled. She threw him a look that could kill with her eyes alone, then took her brother Valavan and went inside.

Mitra watched them go without saying anything and quietly went back to her room.

But only Annadurai's eyes welled up watching the sister and brother. Because he knew the real reason why his wife had summoned Valavan. Even knowing that, the anguish of not being able to save his daughter from that danger was clearly visible in his eyes. But Mitra, who should have found out about it, wasn't there, so what could be done?

In Poonsolai village, when Venthanar said Samshika was "former daughter-in-law," shock spread across everyone's faces.

Those who were already shocked thinking "Is she even a woman?" were left speechless when they heard she was Varman's wife.

That woman's uncivilized appearance and arrogant speech made everyone frown.

Amid this commotion, Yathra, who had been sleeping on Pavithra's shoulder, slowly rubbed her eyes and looked up. When she saw her mother standing there, such a smile appeared on her face! Wasn't she seeing her mother after many days? Immediately, still in Pavithra's arms, "Mother!" she called out to Samshika with joy overflowing.

Samshika's thoughts—that grandfather knew all the truths about her and "How will they let me enter the house now?"—were shattered in a second by Yathra's voice.

Her mind thought at lightning speed. "Aha, this voice calling 'Mother'... I've found my way inside!"

She summoned a fake smile all over her face and, acting as if she had boundless affection for her daughter, "Yathra, darling! Were you here all this time?" she approached Yathra lovingly and took her from Pavithra's arms and hugged her.

Her eyes gleamed not so much with affection for Yathra, but with satisfaction at getting the opportunity to enter the palace.

As soon as Yathra saw her mother, she fell into her false web of affection. What does a child know? If anyone speaks to them affectionately, they'll trust them. Just like that, Yathra too, not knowing her mother's true nature or why she had come there, believed her sweet words.

"Yathra... how many days you've stayed away from Mother all alone... you have no love for me at all!" she said as if her eyes were welling up.

When mother cried, immediately Yathra also said, "Mother, I wanted to see you so badly, but Father wouldn't let me see you!" and the child cried too.

"From now on, Mother can't stay away from you even for a minute!" she shed fake tears while looking sideways at Venthanar.

He too was standing there smiling inwardly, watching the drama she was performing. He already knew that according to their plan, she would definitely enter the palace. So he stood there calmly without saying anything. But others were standing there anxiously thinking that if they let her into the house, their family would definitely not be well.

"Mother! From now on, I won't stay away from you either. Come, let's go inside the house! This is Father's house. Do you know how big this house is? You can stay here too. I'll talk to Grandfather and Father, Mother. Grandfather and Father will listen to what I say," said Yathra in childlike language.

"No, dear. Your father doesn't like me. So they won't let me inside the house," Samshika cried.

Everyone clearly understood that everything she was saying was an act.

"Mother! I'll talk to Father. Come, let's go! Grandfather, Mother will stay with me from now on. I can't be separated from Mother anymore. I told you yesterday, didn't I? Father beat Mother. That's why Mother got angry and left. But now Mother has come looking for us herself. I can't stay without Mother anymore. I'll only come inside the house if Mother is there!" cried Yathra.

Everyone looked at Venthanar, not knowing what to do.

He said without any expression, "Why are you crying now, Yathra dear? You just want your mother to stay in the house, that's all. Okay, I'll let your mother stay. Stop crying and go inside the house," said Venthanar.

Everyone was shocked at what he said and looked at him. He signaled everyone with his eyes to go inside the house.

They too went inside silently without saying anything for Yathra's sake, while Venthanar alone stood at that same place.

Yathra grabbed her mother's hand and took her inside the house. As Samshika entered the house, she looked back at Varman's grandfather, who stood outside watching her, with an arrogant glance and entered.

At the same time, Varman, who was talking with village elders in the temple, received a call: "Information about the girl you're looking for has been obtained." He immediately left to see his grandfather, not knowing that a curse had come and settled in the house.

    content: `While discussing arrangements for the temple festival that would take place in another two weeks with the village elders at the temple, his phone announced its presence.

He picked it up to see who it was—it was his friend calling. After informing those with him, he moved a little distance away to answer the phone. Whatever the person on the other end said made him immediately say he would leave for Madurai and hung up the phone. He told those there, "I need to leave town immediately. It will take at least three days for me to return. Until then, if there's anything important, talk to Grandfather," he said.

"What's this, brother? You just took responsibility today, and already you're saying you need to go to town?" asked someone.

"No, sir! There's an important matter I must go there for. I'm not going there just for personal reasons—it's for the good of our village too," he said.

Hearing him say that, they agreed to let him go without saying anything else.

As soon as they agreed, he took the car at whirlwind speed and went home.

As soon as the car stopped at the palace entrance, he quickly entered the house. As he entered the hall, everyone was sitting there silently.

Just seeing that silence, Varman realized something was wrong. As he approached his family members to inquire, from upstairs, "Daddy!" his beloved daughter Yathra called out and came running.

Seeing his daughter, Varman smiled and picked her up and kissed her on the cheek. "What is it? Is my princess very happy today?" he asked.

"Yes, Daddy! Your princess is very, very happy today. Tell me why—let's see if you know?"

"I don't know. Why is my princess so happy?" he coaxed his daughter.

"Oh, come on, Daddy! Why would I be so happy? I'll be happy when I see my Mommy!" she giggled.

When she said that, he looked up at his grandfather. He too gestured with his eyes as if saying "yes." Then, from upstairs, carrying grace in her walk and arrogance, Samshika descended.

On her face was a mixture of arrogance and a victorious smile. When she met Varman's gaze, for a second, she felt satisfaction thinking that he wouldn't have expected her here and that's why there was this shock on his face.

At the same time, as soon as Yathra saw her mother, she hugged her. Samshika too embraced her and smiled at Varman. That smile had many meanings buried in it. (Him seeing her suddenly at home today was a small shock, but he had expected her next week. Because he also knew that the ticket she had booked for Sunday had been canceled. As soon as he woke up in the morning, the first news he received was that Samshika had canceled her flight ticket. So he thought she wouldn't come this week but would come next week. But now seeing her suddenly at home, he was slightly taken aback—otherwise, he wasn't that shocked that she had come here. But he pretended to be shocked at seeing her.)

Varman, still not recovered from his shock, looked at his family members once. He too noticed the unwillingness on everyone's faces when they saw her.

After a moment, Varman broke the graveyard silence that prevailed there. His eyes remained fixed on Samshika. "You... how did you come here?" His voice mixed shock and anger. (Acting, nothing else, folks.)

Yathra held Samshika's hand and stood next to her.

Samshika smiled indifferently. "My daughter brought me inside. She seems to want me." "I too can't stay without our daughter, that's why I came here," she said.

Hearing what she said, Varman began grinding his teeth in anger.

With that same anger, he looked at his grandfather. He too slowly shook his head, conveying with his eyes alone that he had no choice but to admit Samshika inside because of Yathra.

Anger boiled inside him. Not wanting to make a scene in front of Yathra, he gritted his teeth and looked at Samshika. "What do you want?" his voice came down heavily with pressure.

Samshika casually shrugged her shoulders. "What do I want, you ask? I want my daughter. I'll also stay in this house with her," she said.

"Looking at his face itself is disgusting. For Grandfather's sake, I thought I could tolerate this much, but the more I look, the more revolting it is," he thought while standing there. Meanwhile, his daughter, not understanding the war being waged between her parents, was standing there holding her mother's hand with a blooming face, happy that her mother would now be staying with them.

"Daddy, from now on, Mommy will stay with us!" said Yathra.

Suddenly thinking of something, he immediately asked his daughter, "Yathra, you like Daddy, don't you?"

"Yes, Daddy! I like you very much!" said Yathra.

"Then okay! I agree that your Mommy can stay here for your sake. But your Mommy must stay in a separate room. She shouldn't cause problems with anyone in the house. If that's the case, your Mommy can stay in this house," said Varman.

But having already told Yathra that if he said this, and that if all three stayed in one room, they would be happy together forever without separation, the child believed what she said. So Yathra asked her father to let all three stay in one room.

"Look here, dear. Your Mommy and Daddy have separated. We can't be together anymore. So your Mommy must stay in a separate room," Venthanar said in a firm voice.

As soon as he said that her Mommy and Daddy had separated, Yathra pouted her lips, ready to cry.

Samshika went to pick up Yathra to console her. Before that, Sarvesh picked up the child. "Oh dear, what happened to our little darling? Why are you crying?" he asked affectionately.

"Chittu, Mommy shouldn't stay alone. I'll stay with Mommy too," Yathra said crying.

"Yathra, dear, don't cry. Why do you want to stay with Mommy?" Sarvesh tried to console her.

Before Yathra could answer, Samshika said, "My daughter doesn't need permission from any of you to stay with me," she said angrily.

At that, Varman glared at Samshika and said, "One more time you say 'my daughter' about my daughter, I'll kill you. You have no qualification to call her your daughter. She's my daughter. I'm the one who decides where she stays and who she should be with, not you," he said with fire sparking in his eyes.

"Yathra, your Mommy must stay in a separate room, or tell her to leave the house immediately," he said.

"No, Daddy! I'll stay with Mommy. I want Mommy!" Yathra told her father with tears.

"Yathra!" There was a harshness in Varman's voice that had never been there before.

"Varma, what's this? She's a small child—are you raising your voice at her?" Sathiya Venthan looked at his son angrily.

Not taking what he said to heart at all, "I'm going out of town for three days. During that time, she must stay in Pavithra Aunty's room. Until I come back, she must stay there. Or if I hear that you stayed with your Mommy, your Daddy will forget you," he said angrily.

Seeing the harshness in Varman's voice, Yathra, who had never seen this face of her father before, froze in shock.

This was the first time her Daddy had spoken so angrily. She stood there afraid to even look at her father's face in fear.

Samshika too didn't expect this harshness from Varman. She thought that no matter what happened, he would be calm for his daughter's sake, but seeing his face act completely differently, she looked at him suspiciously.

Having said everything, he left without even looking at his daughter's face, telling everyone in general that he was going out of town for three days, and went quickly to his room. Shortly after, he came with a suitcase in hand and gave only a nod to his grandfather and left from there. Within an hour and a half, the place he arrived at was Madurai Corporation.

    content: `As soon as Varman left the house, Venthanar told the servant there to show Samshika a room to stay in.

A servant there took Samshika's luggage and went ahead. She too approached to take Yathra from Sarvesh.

At that time, Varman's father signaled to his daughter with his eyes. Pavithra too came and stood in front of Sarvesh, shielding them both.

"Hey, idiot! Why are you standing in front of me?" Samshika asked somewhat irritably.

"Didn't you understand what my brother said? Or are you pretending not to understand?" said Pavithra without any fear on her face.

"I don't need to act for you. Move aside properly! I'm taking my daughter and going to my room," said Samshika.

Hearing that, Mangai said, "Listen here, ma! My son clearly said, didn't he? My granddaughter shouldn't stay in your room. So why are you making a problem?"

"Grandma! I'll stay with my Mommy. I can't stay without Mommy!" she told her grandmother.

At that question, little Yathra said to her father, holding on to Samshika's hand, "I'll stay with my Mommy!" and took her mother's hand and led her to the room assigned to Samshika.

A satisfied smile bloomed on Samshika's face seeing Yathra's action.

Everyone in the house looked at each other in shock.

Suddenly, Yathra's behavior seemed different to the others. She who had been standing quietly in fear after hearing Varman speak angrily, suddenly spoke and left as if under some spell—they watched in shock.

"This girl shouldn't have been allowed into our house at all. From the moment I saw her, my heart feels something is wrong," said Mangai.

"What's the use of lamenting now? Your son should have thought about all this when he married her. Now it's too late to worry about whether it's wrong or not. Leave it, Mangai. Whatever is meant to happen will happen," said her mother-in-law, and invited everyone to eat. Others too left from there without saying anything.

Only Venthanar sat at that same place, thinking deeply about something.

Here, having left home, within an hour Varman reached the hotel his friend had mentioned.

There, his friend Sarathi had been waiting for him alone in a private room for a long time. A young man aged 29. His dark complexion, long slightly disheveled hair, beard and mustache gave him a charming appearance. Sharp eyes, a gaze that always seemed to be analyzing something, showed he was a thinker. Though he had a slim build, the firmness in his shoulders showed he was strong. Though he wore ordinary jeans and a t-shirt, a deep intelligence was hidden within his simple appearance.

When Varman came to the room, he saw his friend sitting there. Sarathi too embraced Varman warmly as soon as he saw him. The one who had been everything to him since childhood, whom he had never been separated from even once. This was the first time he was separated from him. Having been separated from him, Sarathi got a little emotional and hugged him. That embrace contained the depth of many years of bonding and a kind of pain from unexpected separation.

Varman too smiled slightly and hugged him, making him sit in the chair next to him. Then the server who entered that room spread their food on the table and left. Shortly after finishing their breakfast, both sat on the sofa there.

"Okay, tell me. How much have you found out?" Varman got straight to the point.

"Varma, I've got information up to when they came to Madurai. After that, I haven't been able to get any news. Now we need to gather all the rest of the information," said Sarathi.

"We don't have much time, Sarathi. I have to go back to town in three days. When I go back to town, I have to go with her," said Varman.

"And another thing... what I didn't expect... this morning, Yathra's mother came to the house," he said calmly.

"What are you saying? This morning, news came to me that she had canceled her flight ticket. That's why I immediately called you and told you," said Sarathi in confusion.

"There's nothing to be confused about in this. Last night, news that Grandfather was going to hand over all responsibilities to me became known to her somehow. That's why she canceled the flight ticket she had booked and came here by her boyfriend's flight," said Varman.

"What are you saying? So David has come here too?" Sarathi asked in shock.

"He didn't come. Only she came. But he'll come here soon. Before he comes here, we somehow have to find my uncle. Only then can we foil her plan," said Varman with a kind of pressure.

"Don't you have even a small clue about where your uncle is?" Sarathi asked.

"No, da. I tried so much. Even last night, I got a small bit of information. When I went and looked there, someone else was there in his name," said Varman, conveying the failure of his attempts.

"Okay, leave all that problem. Now finding that girl is important," said Sarathi.

"Okay, tell your people to immediately collect information about everyone who came to Madurai on the date I mentioned," he said. After some more conversation, both of them left from there.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Only two more days remained until Mitra's wedding.

Wedding work was going on busily throughout the house. More than Mitra, the bride, her younger sister Thanuja was the one who was very busy with clothes, jewelry, facials, etc. Even though Durga called many times, Mitra refused to come to the parlor. Durga too didn't force her and let it go.

For the three days since Valavan came to the house, Mitra's father Annadurai had been secretly pleading with him without anyone knowing. But Valavan gave him no answer, giving only his silence as a reply. The desperation in Annadurai's eyes created no stir within Valavan.

Only the day before the wedding did Mitra's younger brother Roshan come home from the hostel. He liked Mitra much more than Thanuja. Ever since he learned that his beloved sister was getting married, he had been so happy. He had given invitations to all his college friends, insisting they come to the wedding, and had come home.

Tomorrow is the wedding. But Varman still hasn't been able to find the girl he was searching for. Having said he would return to town in three days, four days had passed. Perhaps thinking that if he let it go now, they would lose her without finding her, he kept wandering around without even taking a moment's rest. Every street, every piece of information gave him new hope. But all of them ended only in disappointment in the end.

At Mitra's house, everyone had left to go to the wedding hall since the wedding was tomorrow.

At the groom's house, since Mathesh and his father had invited only their close relatives, only key members were present at that hall from the groom's side. Even Mathesh's mother was consoled with various excuses about why they had invited only their close relatives to the wedding. For some reason, on Mathesh's face, which had no happiness at all on the engagement day, there was happiness now.

That day, there wasn't even the little bit of happiness that had been there on Mitra's face. The thoughts running through her mind were clearly visible on her face.

At the wedding hall, in the evening, all kinds of rituals, music programs, and dances ended in celebration.

Under the spectacular lighting, relatives chatted and laughed enthusiastically. Children and youth danced and enjoyed. Elders were consulting about rituals. While all this was happening on one side, Mathesh and Mitra sat in the midst of that commotion with a kind of detachment.

The noise of the night subsided, and dawn slowly broke. Through the large windows of the hall, the gentle light of dawn, mixed with the fragrance of flowers and the freshness of a new day, spread throughout the hall. Along with it, some murmurs.

"What's this! They called saying it's a wedding for the elder sister—here, the younger sister is getting married!" someone in the hall asked in shock.

"I knew it already! During the engagement itself, this groom was holding the younger sister's hand after putting the ring on the elder sister. I thought maybe it looked wrong to my cursed eyes. Only now do I know about their whole scheme. Poor girl—not only did the wedding not happen even after coming to the wedding stage, but he's tying the thali to her younger sister right in front of her. Will he be well at all?" lamented their neighbor lady.

"The younger sister liked the groom who was chosen for the elder sister, so they're marrying this girl off leaving that girl. Whatever they say, a raised daughter is a raised daughter, a born daughter is a born daughter—did you see?" said another person.

While people in the hall were saying various things, the girl—that is, Mitra—sat on the chair below the stage without any emotion, watching the two people on the stage who were smiling in fake happiness.

"Is there anger on her face?" If asked, definitely not.

But! She was lifeless even while alive.

    subtitle: "Revelations at Dawn",
    content: `4 AM in the bridal chamber. As a few voices could be heard in the wedding hall, our heroine Mitra, who had been sleeping, just woke up. Today was her wedding day. Her friend Durga woke Mitra up and told her to get ready for the wedding.

Mitra went to the bathroom, bathed, and came out. Her future mother-in-law entered the room with a beautician.

"This is my daughter-in-law. You need to get her ready, okay? There's plenty of time until the auspicious moment, so take your time and make her beautiful," she said and left the room.

The beautician seated Mitra and was beautifully displaying her makeup artistry when someone knocked hard on the door from outside. Durga went and opened the door.

Valavan stood there, showing no emotion on his face.

Seeing Valavan outside, Durga turned her face away and went inside.

Since childhood, Mitra, Durga, and Valavan had been close friends despite their age differences. Roshan wasn't with them as he grew up in a hostel. Thanuja never liked Valavan. The main reason for that was Valavan treated Mitra well.

At the age of 27, Valavan married a girl he loved.

Neither Mitra nor Durga liked that girl at all. Valavan married her despite their opposition.

No one knows what happened, but within a year of marriage, the police arrested him saying he had killed his wife.

It was shocking for both friends. They knew there definitely couldn't be any fault on their friend's part. Still, angry that he married her despite all their warnings, they hadn't spoken to him all these days. But after hearing this news, they couldn't stay without talking to him. So both of them went and met him.

The only words he said were "Please forgive me."

After that, he didn't speak a word and didn't meet anyone. After all these years, he came out of jail just four days before Mitra's wedding. When his sister went and met him in jail and said something, he immediately came out.

Since coming out, Mitra, Durga, and Valavan hadn't spoken a single word to each other. He too, thinking something in his mind, didn't speak to either of them.

"Mitra... I need to talk to you a bit," Valavan said in an emotionless voice.

When he said that, Mitra turned and looked at the beautician. The woman also said she would go have coffee and left the room.

As soon as the woman left, Valavan bolted the room door and approached Mitra. Grabbing her hand, "Leave this hall immediately. He's not the one for you. If you stay in this hall a little longer, seeing what happens next will break your heart," he said.

Hearing what he said, both Mitra and Durga looked at him in confusion.

"Uncle, what happened? Why are you talking like this? In a little while, I'm going to get married. Now you come and say, 'He's not the one for you.' How many days has it been since you came out of jail? Have you spoken a single word to me?" Mitra asked, starting angrily but ending with a broken voice, hurt that he hadn't spoken.

Valavan knew that too. He knew that if he didn't speak, Mitra would definitely be hurt. Even knowing that, there was only one reason he remained silent—for her to be safe until he handed her over to the one meant for her.

Now he didn't need to be silent. Because the one meant for her had come searching for her. This wedding would definitely happen today. Both of them would leave this Madurai land together and go to their ancestral place, his inner voice said. That's why he told her to leave the hall immediately.

"Whatever it is, explain it so we can understand. Don't speak in riddles like this—it's irritating me," Durga snapped a bit.

Looking back at her, Valavan clearly saw the anger she had toward him. Though it pained his heart to see it, thinking that wasn't important now, he began to tell Mitra what his sister had told him when she came to the jail.

"Valava, they came to see Mitra for a bride viewing. As soon as we saw that groom, we all liked him. So the groom's family immediately said let's fix the wedding, and we agreed. Four days before the engagement, Thanuja locked me and your father in a dark room with a knife in her hand. She threatened us saying 'I want only Mathesh, I won't marry anyone else.' We didn't know what to do. At that time, we agreed to what she said.

"As soon as we agreed, Thanuja told the groom about this matter, and the groom got a bit angry.

"That day she came crying and told us. We were happy thinking this problem was over. But the very next day, the groom called and said he agreed to marry our younger daughter.

"After Thanuja spoke with the groom, the friends who were with the groom changed the groom's mind by saying various things like Mitra isn't modern enough, dresses simply in saree, so she can't live abroad with him. We didn't know what to do."

"But! After Thanuja heard this, she insisted that if she married, she would only marry Mathesh. Because of my affection for Thanuja, I told your uncle, 'Let our daughter live the life she likes, we can find another groom for Mitra and get her married.' When he said it was absolutely impossible, in a fit of anger, I said, 'Mitra isn't our daughter, she's an orphan. But without caring for our biological daughter Thanuja's life, you're thinking about that orphan.'

"Hearing what I said, Thanuja learned all the truth too. After that, we couldn't control Thanuja at all. So we had to nod to everything she said. We convinced the groom's father about this matter using the groom. Only the groom's mother doesn't know."

Hearing everything she said, Valavan calmly looked at his sister and asked, "What's the connection between the story you're telling now and why you came to see me?"

"It's nothing, Valava? You've liked Mitra since childhood. She likes you too. Both of you always hang around together. We built hope in her saying she's getting married. Where will she find a groom at the last moment? That's why..." Lakshmi hesitated a bit to continue.

"That's why?" Valavan asked, grinding his teeth.

"That's why you marry our Mitra yourself, Valava," said Lakshmi.

Hearing that, his eyes filled with so much anger. If anyone else had talked to him about this at this time, he would have destroyed them right there without a trace. But it was his own sister asking, wasn't it? So he controlled his anger.

"Look here, Valava? I've also gotten the groom's father to agree to get you out. He said he'll hire a big lawyer and get you out. So you must agree to come out without saying anything else, okay?" said Lakshmi.

The one who had been listening and getting angry all this time made some other decision in his mind and said only, "I agree to come out."

He didn't say he would marry. But Lakshmi thought he had agreed to marry and happily took steps to get him out.

"This is what happened," he finished telling everything. Both women stood there frozen, speechless in shock.

Durga, more angry, without even considering that he was older than her in age, slapped Valavan hard.

Valavan was stunned by Durga's slap. Looking up, Durga was burning him with her eyes in anger.

"Where did your sense go when your sister told you? Don't you have any shame coming out of jail to marry? Pfft... are you even human?" Durga asked angrily.

"Durga, don't speak without understanding! I only said I'd come out. I didn't say I'm going to marry Mitra!" Valavan also got angry.

While both glared at each other, nearby Mitra's face showed so much sorrow. With that same sorrow, she left that room and went to where her mother and father were. There, her mother Lakshmi was laughing and talking among relatives.

As soon as she saw her, she went near her and called, "Mother..."

Lakshmi was startled at her voice and turned around. With the auspicious time set for 6 o'clock for her younger daughter, seeing her standing here now was a bit shocking. Still, without showing it outwardly, "What is it, Mitra? What are you doing here at this time? The bride shouldn't come outside like this," she said affectionately.

"Mother, if Thanu liked him, she could have told me directly, right? Why did you deceive me, Mother?" she asked with a broken voice.

Shocked by that, Lakshmi looked at Mitra's face. They had just applied makeup, but because she cried, her eyes were red and kajal smudged, looking pitiful. Though she didn't say what exactly, she understood—Mitra knew everything.

Telling the person next to her, "Wait a minute, I'll be back," she took Mitra a little distance away. "Don't make any problems, Mitra. Your sister's wedding is going to happen in a little while. Don't spoil the wedding by talking about all this at this time," she said.

While she was speaking, Mathesh's mother Chintamani came near them and glared at Lakshmi. "What kind of mother are you all? No mother would do such an act. If your younger daughter liked my son, you should have told Mitra directly or told me directly. Instead of that, you talked to my young son and my husband, confused their minds, and tried to conduct this wedding. What kind of people are you?" she shouted.

Everyone in the hall looked at them. Lakshmi, afraid that there would be a problem, "Samandhi Mother... speak softly please. Everyone is looking at us," she said.

"Let them look! Only then will everyone know your true nature. As a family, you deceived me. You even brought my son and husband into this. Don't you have any shame?" said Chintamani.

"Samandhi Mother, don't speak wrongly. Both children liked each other, so we thought of bringing them together," said Lakshmi.

"Don't you feel ashamed to say this?" While Chintamani kept shouting, her husband came to that place and tried to calm his wife down.

"You don't speak! How could you deceive this girl?" he asked sorrowfully.

"Mani, this isn't the time to talk about that. Look there, your son is sitting on the wedding platform. The wedding is in a little while. Are you going to make problems now?" he said.

"No matter what happens, Mitra is my daughter-in-law! No one can change that no matter what they think!" said Chintamani stubbornly.

When she said that, Lakshmi got angry. "Enough, Samandhi, stop! What fault did you find in the younger daughter?"

"What fault, you ask? Wanting to marry the groom chosen for her elder sister itself is shameful! Isn't that one reason enough?" said Chintamani.

    content: `When Mathesh's mother said that Mitra was her daughter-in-law no matter what, "Enough, Samandhi, stop! What fault did you find with my daughter?" Lakshmi asked angrily.

"What fault, you ask? Wanting to marry the groom chosen for her elder sister itself is shameful! Isn't that one reason enough to reject your younger daughter?" said Chintamani.

"Oh, is that so? So you're rejecting my daughter and trying to marry my son to this orphan who has no one?" said Lakshmi angrily.

At that, tears poured like a waterfall from Mitra's eyes, who had been watching them both with fear all this time.

Even Mathesh's mother Chintamani didn't expect these words at all. "Orphan? What does that mean...?" she thought and looked at Mitra, who was looking at her mother with tears in her eyes.

Lakshmi too, following her gaze and thinking that if she remained silent even after this, her daughter's life wouldn't go as desired, "Yes! She's standing right here. She's not our daughter. She's an orphan. Because she was an orphan with no one, we, being childless, thought of her as our daughter and raised her. Today, she's standing as an obstacle to my daughter's life. If I had known she would stand as such an obstacle, I wouldn't have agreed to raise her," she said without a bit of guilt.

Just then, Mitra's father, who came to that place hearing some commotion in the hall, heard his wife say the word "orphan."

As soon as he heard it, that man froze right there. What he hoped wouldn't happen was now happening there.

Lakshmi's fiery words thundered in Mitra's father's ears like lightning. The secret he had protected for all these years never thought it would break so blatantly. Just thinking of arranging the marriage between Mathesh and Thanuja made him feel guilty toward his eldest daughter. But he never expected his beloved daughter's birth secret itself would be revealed. He stood there like a statue. His legs refused to move as if stuck to the ground.

Mitra looked at her father. Seeing the shock and pain spread across his face broke her heart. His eyes welled up. How many times had he told Mitra, "You're the daughter dearer than my life."

But today, hearing the word "orphan" from her mother's mouth felt like it made all that affection a lie.

The commotion that happened there made everyone turn and look.

Durga and Valavan standing nearby froze in shock. Durga didn't expect this at all. But Valavan, who knew about his sister, thought something like this would definitely happen, but he never expected his sister to call her an orphan in front of so many people.

Durga boiled over. "What are you saying, Aunty? She's an orphan—what does that mean? If someone has no one, can you talk about them like this? Isn't this shameful for you?" Durga shouted furiously.

Following her, Valavan quickly went toward Lakshmi. His face showed so much anger. "Do you know what you're saying, Sister? After calling Mitra your daughter for all these years, you're hurting her with words like this today—don't you have any conscience at all?" Valavan's voice echoed through the hall. His eyes were red.

Chintamani stood there stunned.

Lakshmi was speechless, not knowing what to say. Only after Valavan shouted did she realize what she had done. She didn't speak intentionally—standing before her biological daughter's desire, nothing else was visible to her. So in a rush, she said everything, and only after saying it did she understand what she had said. Looking at her eldest daughter with some confusion, there was no expression on her face. Her mother's word "orphan" and her father's shocked pain told her everything about how true that orphan statement was.

The relatives gathered there watched what happened with disbelief and shock.

Pushing aside all her heartaches in a second, Mitra went near Mathesh's mother and said in a soft voice, "Please conduct this marriage between your son and my sister."

Seeing the determination in Mitra's eyes and noticing something on her son's face, Mathesh's mother agreed to the marriage without saying anything more after that.

Feeling sorry for what happened, she apologized to Mitra and stood aside in a corner.

As soon as she agreed to the marriage, Lakshmi, not thinking about anything else, with joy blooming on her face, immediately went to the wedding platform and hastened the wedding arrangements.

At the same time, Valavan pulled Mitra's hand aside and gave her a locket he had in his hand. "Your real mother had this in her hand when she died. At that age, not knowing what it was, I secretly took it from her hand without anyone knowing. But after reaching a certain age, I somehow kept it safe. Today I brought this in some memory. But I didn't think that after you learned all the truth, this would reach your hand, Mitra," he said.

Whether Mitra listened to what Valavan said or not, only she knew. As the time to tie the thali approached, showing no emotion on her face, she sat on the chair below the stage in bridal decoration, emotionless, watching the two people on stage with fake smiling faces.

"Is there anger on her face?" If asked, definitely not.

But! She was lifeless even while alive.

Just a while ago, those she had thought of as mother and father all these years called her an "orphan," and she collapsed at those words.

From the moment she heard the word orphan, there was no emotion on her face.

"In a little while, the moment the thali went up on her sister's neck, before leaving that hall without anyone knowing, she would have left thinking 'there's no one for me in this world, I'm an orphan.'"

Durga was angrily watching Mathesh tying the thali, so she didn't notice Mitra. But Valavan noticed. But without disturbing her, he followed her without her knowledge.

Though her mother noticed her leaving the hall, she didn't come to stop her. Thinking where would she go, she'd have to come home, she thought and went to perform the other rituals. But the one thing she never thought was that today would be the last day she'd see her.

Mitra's father had been sitting like one possessed since learning that his daughter knew all the truths.

Since Mitra's brother didn't know about the plan of mother, father, and Thanuja, thinking the auspicious time was seven o'clock, he went to call his friends. So he didn't know anything that happened in the hall.

Here, Mitra who left the hall, not even knowing where she was going, with eyes welling up, legs moved on their own. No clarity on where to go. In every step, a pain... in every breath, a cry. She didn't think of place, didn't think of direction... thought only one thing—the sudden emptiness.

On the road, the sound of moving vehicles, the screech of the wind... even with many people nearby, she felt her world was caught in darkness. Every step reminded her of the emptiness of her life.

At that time, she had no favorite place. That journey without answers to where to go, whom to seek... even while in so much pain, she didn't drop that locket in her hand. Somehow she held it thinking it shouldn't leave her. Now not just that locket, the owner of that locket also belonged only to her.

Then, due to excessive mental stress, as her head spun and she was about to fall down, a strong arm caught and held her.

The owner of that strong arm! Stood frozen looking at the lotus flower face in his hands.

Is this girl's body as soft as a temple flower?

Will it bruise if touched like a tender shoot?

As the breeze glides over the beautiful petals,

Did a thousand colors come together in her beauty!

A body like silk, a pleasure to behold,

Is she a rose petal touched by dew drops!

When walking, not even a burden to the earth,

Is she the total form of grace!

If her touch falls, the mind will swoon,

You temple flower with such softness!

"Won't this angel like a temple flower come into my life?" arose in the mind of that six-foot man.

Who could that six-foot man be?

    subtitle: "Destined Encounter",
    content: `Watching the two people seated on the wedding platform, Durga felt so much anger. Especially seeing Mathesh's smiling face made her so angry she wanted to kill him. With that same anger, "If you determine someone's life by just looking at their beauty, that life will never be good! This is just external appearance. The character inside is what guides a relationship to the end!" she said angrily and turned to her friend's side. Only then did she notice that both Mitra and Valavan were missing. With anxiety, she left that hall.

All this time, Mathesh's face which had been smiling, as if Durga's words wiped away all the smile. Noticing this, Thanuja spoke to him about various things and diverted his mind. She signaled to her mother, who also made arrangements to take the bride and groom home.

Mathesh's mother, who had been standing alone without participating in any activity there, not wanting to stand there anymore, left for home.

Here, Mitra walking wherever her feet took her, finally came and stood in front of that Shiva temple she always visited. The moment she was about to faint and fall, lacking strength in both body and mind, an iron arm caught and held her.

Looking at the girl lying like a wilted flower in his hand, "Won't this angel like a temple flower come into my life?" his mind murmured. Only after a few seconds did what his mind said reach his brain. Startled, he looked at the jasmine flower wilting in his hand.

Without his knowledge, his mind had leaned toward her. Immediately pushing away his unnecessary thoughts, he looked around. Were there others who came with this girl? Some people stood watching them curiously but didn't come close to them.

Glaring at them with his eyes, the moment he lifted the girl like a flower in his arms, suddenly the wind blew strongly, thunder rumbled, dark clouds gathered, and rain started early in the morning.

Immediately, without thinking about anything, he entered the nearby Shiva temple carrying her in his arms—Varman.

(Yes, the arms that caught and held Mitra were Varman's. The one who had been searching street by street for four days. Today, if he couldn't find his Bappu, he'd have to return to town again. In that situation, when he and Sarathi were having tea at a shop near that Shiva temple where Mitra was, seeing a woman with her back turned about to faint and fall, and a car coming from the other side, Varman dropped the tea in his hand and went at lightning speed to catch and hold her.)

Until then, Valavan, who stood aside watching everything that happened, had a slight smile on his face. That's what he thought, right! She went into the hands she was meant to join. Thinking his duty was done, Valavan felt relieved.

Yes, he knew who he was. Four months ago, when he first kept getting dreams of Varman holding Mitra, confused about what it meant, only then did he remember that locket. Immediately telling the guard there that he wanted to see his friend Nikhil, the guard was shocked.

Because he too knew that since coming to jail, he hadn't allowed anyone to visit. Only once did he meet his friends, after which he said he didn't want to meet anyone. But today, when he himself came saying he wanted to meet his friend, he was shocked.

Then he too informed Valavan's friend Nikhil of the news. Two days later, Nikhil had come to meet Valavan.

Valavan and Nikhil studied in the same college in different departments. Valavan studied Agriculture, and Nikhil studied to become a lawyer.

To his friend who came to see him, he spoke about the locket in his room and asked him to find out without anyone knowing whose it was, which town, everything. Nikhil also told Lakshmi that certain documents were needed to get Valavan out, took the locket from Valavan's room, and in a month collected all the information.

Telling Valavan everything he had collected, Valavan thought about something and said, "Don't tell anyone about this. In a few days, I'll come out myself," and sent him away.

When his sister came to call him 20 days ago, he first refused, but then thinking he should save Mitra from them and place her where she belonged, he came out of jail.

When leaving the hall, he came after Mitra thinking he should unite her with her family. But by then, she had already gone into the hands she was meant to be with.

After this, thinking whether he should stay here or not, Valavan stood there when Durga came near him anxiously.

"What? You're standing alone? Where's Mitra, uncle?" she asked with anxiety.

"Mitra is inside the temple," saying only that, he turned to leave from there.

"Saying she's inside the temple, where are you turning back to go? Come, let's go inside and see what she's doing. She shouldn't be alone now," without even asking what he was going to say, she dragged Valavan along.

Following them, the one who was anxiously wondering after his friend suddenly dropped the tea in his hand and ran.

Seeing him carry that girl in his arms and enter the temple in the blink of an eye, Sarathi was shocked.

Then, paying the shopkeeper for the tea they drank and the broken glass, he too went into that temple. Seeing the scene there, Sarathi froze.

His shock lasted only a few seconds. Immediately he quickly went near his friend.

"Hey! What are you doing?" he brought his friend back to his senses.

Until then, as if under some spell doing everything, he came to his senses only after his friend called him.

Still, without saying anything, he kept looking at "his own one! Without blinking" standing before him with tears in her eyes.

Somehow he couldn't bear to see her tears. So when he wiped her tears with his iron hand, not knowing why, her tears increased even more then.

Unable to watch that, he immediately pulled her and embraced her to his chest. Both their hearts felt as if they had found something they'd been searching for many days.

Seeing both of them standing embraced, Sarathi exclaimed "Oh no!"

"Hey! What are you doing? For four days, I wanted 'my Bappu,' saying I'll go to town with my Bappu, making me wander street by street without even letting me eat, and now what are you doing—tied the thali and standing embraced like this?" mentally washing his friend thoroughly, whether he heard it or not, Varman glared at his friend while keeping Mitra in his embrace.

Seeing him look, Sarathi softly asked, "Hey! Do you remember why you came here?"

Without answering what he asked, he took out the locket Mitra had from his pocket and gave it to him. Taking and looking at it, his face showed such happiness.

Looking at his friend's face with that same happiness, when he said 'yes' with his eyes, in joy Sarathi separated Mitra from him and embraced her. Mitra, in his embrace, blinked and turned back to look at Varman, her sudden husband burning in jealousy.

All this time, Durga, who had been watching what was happening while holding Valavan's hand, seeing Varman tie the thali to her and both of them hugging her friend, bit Valavan's hand and escaped from him, ran and came, separated Sarathi from Mitra and made him stand behind her.

"Hey! Who are you both?" she asked while glaring at both of them.

Before they could answer, Valavan who came to that place said, "They have more rights over her than us, Durga."

Varman looked at him puzzled. "I'm Mitra's friend," he said.

"Does tying the thali give them more rights than us?" Durga snapped at Valavan.

"I asked who you both are. How dare you tie the thali on her neck?" she looked angrily at Varman. Seeing that, Varman's rough lips smiled secretly and thought about what happened a while ago.

The one who carried the fainted girl into the temple, getting water from the priest there and sprinkling it on her face, in a short while her sculpted eyes slowly opened and looked at the one before her without blinking.

Then the priest asked, "How are you feeling now, ma?"

Looking at him, she nodded saying "Nothing," and he too moved away from that place.

Until then, Varman, who had been looking at her, only then saw the locket in her hand. His eyes startled and tried to take it from her hand.

She held it tightly and glared at him. Not minding that, "How did this come to you?" he asked with trembling.

The moment he first saw her, she had created turmoil in his mind. But when his 'Bappu' memory came, he immediately pushed aside his unnecessary thoughts and had carried her into the temple just to help her.

Now, seeing their family's ancestral locket in her hand, with many prayers in his mind hoping that his 'Bappu' he was searching for must be her, he looked at her to see what she would say. But before she could answer, the moon-like birthmark on her right hand itself showed who she was.

At that same time, when he asked, without her knowledge, "This is the only thing I have as my own. Those whom I thought were my family all these days aren't my family," she looked at his face with tears in her eyes. Before she could finish "I'm an orph..." he put his hand on her mouth and stopped her from speaking.

Taking the locket from her hand, "This locket isn't the only thing that's yours. From now on, this Varman also belongs only to you," he said.

Before she could think what, pulling her hand, he took her and tied the mangalsutra that was tied there for prayers around her neck.

That was when the three of them had entered the temple.

Thinking about that, his eyes unknowingly welled up slightly thinking of someone.

At that time, when Sarathi's phone rang and he answered, seeing the panic on his face, Varman asked, "What?"

With that same panicked face, "He escaped. He's gone to the palace," said Sarathi.

    content: `Sarathi looked at the woman who suddenly separated his younger sister from him in confusion, and within that confusion, Durga started shouting angrily at them. On top of that, addressing both of them with 'Da' (an informal way of addressing), anger arose in our Sarathi boy.

"Hey! Who are you talking to like that? If you continue, I'll talk to you the same way. Are you a girl? Why are you shouting like a street vendor!" When he shouted back at her in anger, Mitra stood caught between these two, just blinking.

She didn't find Sarathi's embrace wrong. It felt like the affection of a brother embracing his sister. So she didn't take that matter seriously. However, while she struggled to understand her own heart—wondering why she felt not even the slightest anger toward the man who had tied a thali around her neck without saying a single word to her, and instead felt a desire to remain in his embrace—she stood blinking at these two fighting between them, when Sarathi's phone rang to save her from them.

Sarathi too, without even looking at who was calling at this time, took the phone and put it to his ear. Upon hearing what was said from the other side, Sarathi was shocked.

Seeing Sarathi's face change after the phone call, Varman asked, "What?"

"He escaped from the place where we had locked him up," Sarathi said hesitantly and softly so only he could hear.

That was also heard by Valavan, who was nearby. Looking at them both suspiciously, when Varman noticed him, "Business matter," Varman brushed it off, and Valavan, who smiled slightly at that, said, "I know not only the truth about Mitra, but everything about you both," emphasizing the word "everything" slightly. At that, Sarathi looked at him shocked, while Varman looked at him without any expression.

"You must have been hiding your identity from everyone and living all these years because you have some problem. But now I'm sending Mitra with you trusting you. Nothing should happen to her," he said to both of them.

Going near Mitra, he gently stroked her head and said, "I thought I knew where to place you, but you've joined the hands you were meant to be with."

Without understanding what he said, both women looked at Valavan with confusion.

Noticing that, Valavan took Mitra's hand and placed it in Varman's hand, joining the locket in both their hands, and said, "This is your life hereafter, and also your true kinship. I came out of jail only to hand you over to this true relationship. I never thought it would happen automatically."

Only then did what he meant to say become clear to Mitra, and she looked at her husband shocked, while he looked at her and winked his eyes beautifully and smiled.

With everything that happened today being shocking events, Mitra stood silently not knowing what to say.

Looking at them both with satisfaction, Valavan brought the shocked Durga, who had been standing there, to his memory and explained the truth to her, telling her that she must stay with them from now on. With tears in her eyes, she embraced her friend, and Valavan and Durga left from there. Before leaving, he took their number saying he could be called for help at any time and gave his phone number before leaving.

After they both left that place, "Look here, Bappu, you may not understand what he said. But don't confuse your mind thinking about it. No matter what happens, you must have complete trust in me," Varman said with authority.

Her innate nature is to think about everything and make decisive decisions. The only decision she made without thinking was agreeing to marry the groom her father showed her. Otherwise, Mitra is someone who thinks patiently about everything and makes decisive decisions. From the moment he tied the thali around her neck, she had already decided that her life was with him. Now, after Valavan said what he did, she was firmly determined that her life was with him from now on.

"No matter what happens, the trust I have placed in you will never change," she said with determination, and seeing that, his heart struggled with an indescribable feeling.

Then Sarathi said, "Bappu, I'm your brother," and laughed, and she laughed too. But that laughter was only on her lips and not in her eyes.

No matter what, when told that those she had considered her family for all these years were not, she couldn't bear it at all.

After a while of their conversation, telling Sarathi, "Finish all the work here and come to town in two days," Varman left, taking Mitra with him.

In exactly two hours, they arrived in front of the Venthanar Palace where they had come from.

Without even noticing that the car had stopped, Mitra sat there as if in a trance.

"Mitra!" When Varman called, she turned toward him at his voice and looked at him as if asking "What?"

"Until I tell you the truth about who you are, no one here should know. You are the girl who belongs to this house. I will tell you when the time comes, okay?" he said.

With her trust in him, she nodded her head as if saying "okay" and got down from the car.

Without even noticing that there was a palace-like house in front of her, with what happened at the hall repeatedly coming to her memory and disturbing her heart, in that memory, not even noticing Varman holding her hand and taking her along, she went with him without feeling.

Since Varman had informed Venthanar beforehand that he was coming, Venthanar was sitting in a chair in front of the house with his wife, waiting for Varman's arrival.

Just then, Varman came and stood before them with his wife.

The first to see him was his grandmother Mangalammal. Shocked at seeing her grandson standing there, she called her daughters-in-law and sons. When everyone in the house came out wondering what was happening, they were shocked to see the heir of their house standing there.

The first to recover from that was his mother Mangai. "What is this, Varma? Who is this girl? Why did you bring her here?" Mangai asked her son, looking at the girl standing next to him with an emotionless face and a thali around her neck.

Unable to look at anyone's face and answer, for the first time in his life, he bowed his head and said to everyone in general, "She is my wife," in his authoritative voice.

Those in his house who were shocked to see him standing with his head bowed, reached the height of shock at the word "wife" he said next.

"Varma, do you know what you've done in the problem the house is facing now?" his father asked.

"I know, Dad! But I haven't done anything wrong. You trust me, don't you?" Varman said looking directly at his father.

"It's because I trust you that I haven't said a word to you even though so many problems have occurred in the house. But what you've done and come with now is not a simple matter. Do you know where this will lead you?" his father asked angrily.

"Whatever problem comes, I can face it, Dad," he said firmly.

With the unshakeable trust in his son, without saying anything else, "Mangai, bring the daughter-in-law inside," he ordered his wife, and taking everyone in his family with him, he went inside the house.

Mangai too performed the aarthi for her son and daughter-in-law with a reluctant smile. When asked to enter with their right foot first, Varman, holding his wife's hand tightly, took the right foot together and entered. The next moment, with a shout of "Daddy!" a tiny tot grabbed Varman's leg and stood there.

Even that she didn't feel, and Varman's wife stood next to him with that same emotionless face. Nothing happening here registered in her brain. It must be said that her thoughts were spinning around what happened at the hall to that extent.

But seeing that child holding Varman's leg, fear was on everyone's faces in Varman's family about "what will happen after this?"

"Yathra! Dad just came into the house, why are you already bothering him?" said Yathra's mother Samshika, coming dressed in clothes completely unsuitable for that house.

Looking at her, everyone's faces showed such revulsion. Yet, unable to show anything outside, they stood suppressing their anger.

"Daddy! Who is she? Why did she come to our house?" Yathra asked looking at the woman next to Varman.

The moment the child asked that, without any hesitation, embracing his wife with one hand and lifting Yathra with the other, "She is my wife. Your mother," said Varman.

Hearing what Varman said, Yathra, who screamed "No!", got down from Varman's hand, stood next to Samshika, and said, "She is my mother! She is not my mother!" angrily, that tiny tot.

Seeing Yathra speak, Shailu looked at Varman with contempt and thought to herself, "No matter how hard you try, you can't defeat me, Varma. Your daughter is going to help me complete what I came to do," and smiled cruelly.

Hearing what Yathra said, Varman glared at Samshika and said angrily, "Yathra! She is not your mother. She is your mother. From now on, you must call only her mother."

But, "I'm not someone who fears your anger," as if saying that, looking directly at her father, "I don't like her. I won't call her mother. I don't like her, and she shouldn't stay in this house either. Send her out of this house immediately!" she said angrily.

Varman looked at his daughter with shock, opposing him like this. Varman understood that in the days he wasn't here, Samshika had planted her purpose in his daughter's mind. Now Varman said patiently, "Look here, Yathra, Dad is telling you, from now on she is your mother."

At that moment, "Why should my daughter call strangers mother?" a man's voice angrily echoed at the doorway of the house. At that voice, everyone turned toward the doorway. Seeing the person standing there, everyone in the house froze, and Varman's mother fainted in shock and fell down.

    content: `Varman looked at his daughter with shock as she opposed him like this.

Understanding that in the days he wasn't here, Samshika had shown her work, Varman said gently, "Look here, Yathra, Dad is telling you, from now on she is your mother."

At that moment, "Why should my daughter call strangers mother?" a man's voice angrily echoed at the doorway of the house. A smile that no one knew about came on Varman's face.

With that same smile, he turned toward the doorway, and the people in the house also turned toward the doorway at that voice.

Standing there with a face looking exactly like Varman, his face full of anger, everyone in the house froze seeing him, and Varman's mother fainted in shock and fell down.

With both having the same facial expression, Yathra didn't know which was her "Daddy." Even for a minute, even Samshika couldn't identify her husband with whom she lived, to that extent the facial similarity between the two was the same.

Those who were greatly shocked in this were Venthanar, his sons, and his grandson Varman—only these four. They weren't shocked looking at the person standing at the doorway.

The one who entered angrily inside, seeing Yathra standing there, left all his anger and hurried and embraced the child.

When suddenly embraced, the child looked at her mother a bit frightened. She was looking at the new person with shock.

Seeing the child look at her, frightened, looking at Varman who was mocking him from there, burning him with his eyes, he picked up Yathra in his hand and asked, "Pink Princess! Don't you recognize Daddy?"

Yathra, who had been frightened all this time in his father's appearance, at his call of "Pink Princess," hugged him saying "Daddy!"

She too didn't like that for a month her father wasn't calling her as usual but was calling her differently, though what does a 5-year-old child know?

At the same time, laying the fainted Mangai on the sofa there, sprinkling water, they brought her to consciousness. In a short while, she too opened her eyes and looked. When Chandra Venthan's wife Vasanthi, who was near her, seated her properly.

When fully recovered from fainting, Mangai looked at the doorway to see if what she saw was real. No one was there, so she wondered if what she saw was a dream. "Vasanthi!" When she turned calling her, Varman was standing in front of her, and opposite him, someone with his appearance was standing with the child in hand.

As soon as she saw him, with tears in her eyes, "Maran!" When Mangai called and approached the new person, as soon as he heard that name, his entire body burned with anger.

With that same anger, "I'm not Maran, I'm Nandhan!" he shouted.

At that, everyone looked at Varman shocked, while he just stood coolly. But his wife came to her senses at the new person's shout and immediately identified that the person standing in a coat suit with her husband's appearance in anger was not her husband, with slight shock looking at the new person and others alternately. Then she looked pitifully at her husband who was embracing her, like a small child stuck in an unknown place.

Seeing that, Varman felt like laughing, but considering the place, he stood quietly.

But Venthanar's wife standing there asked shocked, "What's happening here? Are you Nandhan? Then you're Maran?"

No one understood one thing: why would he come here lying by saying Nandhan when he was Maran, who hadn't come to this town for all these years and was thought to be not even alive? But one thing everyone knew well was that he was Maravarman.

Without answering what his grandmother asked, looking at the person standing in front of him glaring, Varman (Maravarman) asked somewhat mockingly, "You look very thin. Didn't anyone feed you properly?"

Handing Yathra who was in his hand to Pavithra, he asked them to go to the room.

She too looked at her two brothers with wonder and took the child and went inside, and Kavya also left.

When they entered the room, "Grandpa, who is he? You said he was dead. You even said I killed him and sent me out of this town. Now how did he come alive?" Nandha Varman asked angrily.

"How will they know if you ask them, brother?" asked Mara Varman, who had been acting as Nandha Varman all these days.

"Who's whose brother, you rascal? All these days, after kidnapping me and locking me up, you came here in my name? Don't you have shame?" Nandhan asked angrily.

Hearing what he said, the people in the house looked at both shocked.

"Don't be angry, Dad. Let's ask brother what happened," Mangai said, holding his hand, and he pushed her hand away and stood aside.

"I didn't come here to have a relationship with any of you. I came here only to take my daughter from here," said Nandhan.

"What, Raja? As soon as you came, you're saying you're leaving from here?" his grandmother said holding Nandhan's hand, and going near Maran, holding his hand, "Look here, grandchildren, I don't know what happened between you before. But from now on, for Grandfather's sake, you both must live in harmony. When you fell from the mountain as a child and we thought Maran died, we've been thinking all these years. Now he's standing alive before our eyes. Now it feels like our family is complete. Now you're saying you're leaving the house, Raja?"

When Mangalammal said with her eyes welling up, both her grandsons embraced her.

"Okay, Grandma, for your sake I agree to stay here. But one thing: he shouldn't stay in this house. If he stays here, I won't stay in this house," said Nandhan.

Everyone stood looking at each other's faces, not knowing what answer to give.

"What are you looking at? Knowing that your precious boy, after coming from abroad, kidnapped me and even acted as father with my daughter for all these days in this house. Should I stay with him?!" he said with disgust.

"What's happening here?" Sathya Venthan shouted in anger at how they were behaving.

When he shouted, for a moment Mitra was frightened and held Maran's hand tightly and looked at him with fear.

"Dad, why are you shouting now? You want to know what happened, right? I'll tell you myself," said Maran. "A month ago, he came here from abroad. When I found out he came here, I kidnapped him and locked him in a house and came to this town with Yathra. Enough?"

At that, angry Nandhan unexpectedly kicked the person standing in front of him with his leg.

In that, Maran stumbled slightly and fell down, and Mitra, who was holding his hand, also fell down when he was kicked. But when falling, she fell on the teapoy beside and got slightly injured on her forehead and blood oozed from Mitra.

Seeing Mitra who fell down, Maran panicked and held Mitra's hand and made her sit on the sofa there. Only then did he see the injury on her forehead with blood oozing.

Maran, who had been playful and patient all this time, seeing the blood on his wife's forehead, from where so much anger came no one knows, he started beating without seeing anything in anger. All this happened within the blink of an eye.

"Mara! What are you doing? Leave Nandhan!" his father and uncle tried to stop him. But they couldn't stop him even slightly, to that extent was his speed. Maran's beating left Nandhan's face full of injuries.

"Mara! What are you doing? Leave him!" Only after Venthanar said that did he leave Nandhan.

"Sathya, take Nandhan to his room," Venthanar said and sent them away, then turned toward Maran and asked with slight emphasis, "Do you know what you've done?"

"I know very well what I'm doing," Maran said angrily, and taking Mitra, who was standing there not understanding anything that was happening, frightened looking at Maran, he took her hand and left angrily from there.

With Varman suddenly getting married and coming, before that ended, Nandhan came, Maran was here all these days as Nandhan, then the fight between them—everyone had gone crazy seeing all this.

But without participating in any of this, only Samshika stood quietly. Though Maran being alive was slightly shocking to her, seeing the brothers fighting each other made her happy. Immediately thinking she should tell her father what happened here, without anyone knowing, she entered her room and called her father.

In a short while, the phone was answered from that side. "Dad, do you know what's happening here? You said 20 years ago that Mara Varman died, but that Mara Varman is standing alive here," she said. Hearing that, the person on that side was shocked for a moment.

"What are you saying? Is he alive? That's impossible. I pushed him from the mountain myself and made everyone believe all these years that his brother pushed him. Then how can he come alive? Did you check properly?"

"Dad, just now I came seeing it with my own eyes," she said with slight emphasis.

"What should I do now?" her father asked.

"Dad, whether he's alive or not, it doesn't matter to us. Because the Suriyan matcham belongs to Nandhavarman. So if we need to get what we want, we need Nandhavarman. Not Maravarman," said Samshika.

"What you're saying is right. All these years we've been waiting, and in another two months, the fruit is going to come to our hands. Until then, you watch your daughter and your husband carefully. I've been telling you again and again, don't show your character to Nandhavarman. Adjust a bit until our work is done. But you hastily showed your true character to him, and not only did he chase you out of the house, but he also divorced you," her father said angrily.

"Dad, there's no use talking about what's finished. No matter how much that Nandhan let go of my hand, Yathra is still in my hands. So it's easy to finish our work with her," said Samshika.

"Then one more important thing, Dad. That Maran has been living in this house under the name 'Nandhan' all these days. Even I couldn't identify that. Four days ago, he left saying important work, and this morning he comes and stands with a girl. Also claiming her as his wife. Until then even I couldn't truly identify that he was Maran. Only after that did my ex-husband Nandhan come into the house. Even for a moment I was shocked. 'Who is this new guy?' Then I found out he's my husband, and Maran has been living in this house saying his name all these days. Something seems wrong to me. The one who hasn't come to this town all these years and was thought to be not even alive has suddenly come, and two months before Maha Shivaratri he's come here—something seems wrong to me, Dad," she said.

"Nothing like what you're thinking will be there. Without thinking about anything, just do the work I told you correctly. I'll take care of the rest," her father said and hung up the phone.

But in Samshika's mind, Maran's sudden coming was slightly irritating. Still, after her father said that, without thinking about it, she started planning how to make Nandhan fall into her trap.

At the same time, Varman, who angrily pulled Mitra's hand and came to his room, was still walking here and there in the room with his anger not subsiding, while she stood aside looking at him with fear.

Pavithra came and stood in front of him walking here and there. "Brother, Mother is calling you and sister-in-law downstairs," she said.

"For what?" he looked at his sister not understanding.

"It's something about performing a ritual. Mother is asking you to come," said Pavithra.

"Okay," said Varman and took Mitra and came down again. There, only the women of the house were present.

"Mangai, look, grandson and granddaughter-in-law have come. Take them to the pooja room," said Mangalammal.

The people who had spoken well to him when he was Nandhan, once they knew he was Maran, no one came forward to speak to him. He too didn't take it seriously.

As his mother-in-law said, taking them both to the pooja room, Mangai made Mitra light the lamp through her.

In a short while, all the rituals were completed, and everyone was sitting in the hall, when Maran's phone rang. Taking it to see who it was, his grandfather had called.

Taking the phone and standing at a distance, he answered, and he asked him to come up to Nandhan's room.

He too said "okay" to him, and without saying anything to his mother, telling Mitra "I'll talk to Grandfather and come," he left from there.

Sathya Venthan, who took Nandhan to his room, left to see other work due to the problem that occurred at home, and his younger brother Chandra Venthan also left to see their daily work. In a short while, Venthanar came to that room, and behind him, Maran also came.

Seeing Maran, Nandhan started shouting.

"Hey! Why are you shouting unnecessarily now? Didn't I tell you not to come here now? Who asked you to come here?" Maran looked angrily at his brother.

"Why should I listen to what you say?" Nandhan flared up.

"What? Wasn't the beating you got downstairs enough?" he said, cracking his knuckles and approaching him.

"Hey! Will you both stop fighting first! How big a problem am I talking about, and you both are fighting like small children," Venthanar scolded them both, and they stood glaring at each other silently.

"Grandpa, you called me on the phone and asked me to come to India. Then why did he kidnap me? Not only did he kidnap me, but he also tied me to a madwoman there," said Nandhan.

"Hey! How dare you suddenly call that girl mad? Don't you know who she is? Even knowing, how dare you call her mad?" Maran asked angrily.

"Will you both shut your mouths now or not? If the sound you're making is heard outside, all the trouble we've taken all these days will go to waste. So will you both be quiet for a while until I speak?" said Venthanar.

"Grandfather, why are you shouting unnecessarily now? You know what? Do you know about the drama that happened downstairs? One woman would have called her father after seeing it. Do you know how you caught that Samshika mookee for your grandson?" said Maran.

"Hey! For a moment, let me speak! Don't torture me," he said unable to bear their torture.

"Okay, tell us, Grandpa. What should you say now?" said Maran.

"Look here, Nandha, everything that happened downstairs was correct. But why did you kick Maran?" he asked.

"I kicked him as punishment for what he locked me up and tortured me there. But when I thought he would fall down and break his skull, his wife standing next to him fell down and is standing with her skull broken," said Nandhan.

"Hey! Speak respectfully! She's your sister-in-law! If you speak of her as 'her' or 'that' one more time, the beating you got downstairs was less, watch out!" said Maran.

"Mara, you too be a bit patient. He kicked you innocently as a joke. That's why why did you beat him until his face swelled?" Venthanar asked.

"Look here, Grandpa, I'll do everything you say, I'll listen patiently. But if anything happens to my Bappu, I won't spare anyone, even if it's you!" he said with slight emphasis.

"Yeah, great Bappu. As if you've been cooing over her since birth. You're talking as if you saw her only four hours ago. Already you have so much affection for her?" Nandhan asked mockingly. (As if he's forgotten the beating he got from him, he's speaking like this again to get another beating.)

"I may not have seen her for all these years. But when she first came to this world, it was by my hands that I received her. For all these years without seeing her, I've kept her alive in my chest," said Maran.

After hearing what he said, Nandhan didn't say anything else. He too knew his brother was crazy about his Bappu, yet he spoke to him a bit jokingly.

"Look here, Nandha, I'm telling you again, even if you interfere in any of my matters, I won't mind, but if you do anything in my Bappu's matter, I won't see you as a brother, I'll bury you alive!" he said angrily.

"Okay, leave it, Mara. The main reason I called you both to talk is about finding your younger uncle. Your elder uncle is coming tomorrow to leave his daughter here. He just called me and asked me to keep his daughter here for a few days. I also said okay. Maran, you also watch him well. I have doubts about him too. We found out that this girl and her father are the reason for all the problems. But we don't know who her father is. We need to find him soon," said Venthanar.

"You poor things! Are you all gang thieves? I thought what happened downstairs was real seeing the fight."

In a short while, the phone was answered from that side. "Dad, you know what's happening here? The Mara Varman you said died 20 years ago is standing alive here," she said.

The person on that side was shocked for a moment upon hearing that. "What are you saying? Is he alive? That's impossible. I myself pushed him from the mountain and made everyone believe all these years that his brother pushed him. Then how can he come alive?"

At the same time, Varman, who angrily pulled Mitra's hand and came to his room, was still walking here and there in the room with his anger not subsiding, while she stood aside looking at him with fearful eyes.

Pavithra came and stood in front of him walking here and there. "Brother, Mother is calling you and sister-in-law downstairs," she said.

"For what?" he looked at his sister not understanding.

"It's something about performing a ritual. Mother is asking you to come," said Pavithra.

"Okay," said Varman and took Mitra and came down again. There, only the women of the house were present.

The people who had spoken well to him when he was Nandhan, once they knew he was Maran, no one came forward to speak to him. He too didn't take it seriously.

As his mother-in-law said, taking them both to the pooja room, Mangai made Mitra light the lamp.

In a short while, all the rituals were completed, and everyone was sitting in the hall, when Maran's phone rang. Taking it to see who it was, his grandfather had called.

Taking the phone and standing at a distance, he answered, and he asked him to come up to Nandhan's room.

He too said "okay" to him, and without saying anything to his mother, telling Mitra "I'll talk to Grandfather and come," he left from there.

Sathya Venthan, who took Nandhan to his room, left his younger brother Chandra Venthan and left to see their daily work due to the problem that occurred at home. In a short while, Venthanar came to that room, and behind him, Maran also came.

Seeing Maran, Nandhan started shouting.

"Hey! Why are you shouting unnecessarily now? Didn't I tell you not to come here now? Who asked you to come here?" Maran looked angrily at his brother.

"Why should I listen to what you say?" Nandhan flared up.

"Grandpa, why are you shouting unnecessarily now? You know what happened downstairs? Seeing the drama that happened downstairs, one woman would have called her father. Everyone is united in gang thievery. How did you catch that Samshika mookee for your grandson?" said Maran.

"Hey! For a moment, let me speak without you torturing me!" he said unable to bear what they were doing.

"Okay, tell us, Grandpa. What should you say now?" said Maran.

"Look here, Nandha, everything that happened downstairs was correct. But why did you kick Maran?" he asked.

"I kicked him innocently as a joke. But when I thought he would fall down, his wife standing next to him fell down and broke her head," said Nandhan.

"Hey! Speak respectfully! She's your sister-in-law! If you speak of her as 'her' or 'that' one more time, watch out!" said Maran.

"Mara, you too be a bit patient. He kicked you innocently as a joke. That's why why did you beat him until his face swelled?" Venthanar asked.

"Look here, Grandpa, I'll do everything you say, I'll listen patiently. But if anything happens to my Bappu, I won't spare anyone, even if it's you!" he said with slight emphasis.

"Yeah, great Bappu. As if you've been cooing over her since birth. You're talking as if you saw her only four hours ago. Already you have so much affection?" Nandhan asked mockingly.

"I may not have seen her for all these years. But when she first came to this world, it was by my hands that I received her. For all these years without seeing her, I've kept her alive in my chest," said Maran.

After hearing what he said, Nandhan didn't say anything else. He too knew his brother was crazy about his Bappu, yet he spoke to him a bit jokingly.

"Look here, I'm telling you again. I won't mind even if you interfere in any of my matters, but if you do anything in my Bappu's matter, I won't see you as a brother, I'll bury you alive!" he said angrily.

"Okay, leave it, Maran. The main reason I called you both to talk is about finding your younger uncle. Your elder uncle is coming tomorrow to leave his daughter here. He just called me and asked me to keep his daughter here for a few days. I also said okay. Maran, you also watch him well. I have doubts about him too. We found out that this girl and her father are the reason for all the problems. But we don't know who her father is. We need to find him soon," said Venthanar.

"You poor things! Are you all gang thieves? I thought what happened downstairs was real seeing the fight," thought someone watching all this.

"Grandpa, why are you shouting unnecessarily now? You know what? Do you know about the drama that happened downstairs? Seeing it, one woman would have called her father. Are you all united in gang thievery?" said Maran.

"Hey! Why suddenly call that girl mad? Don't you know who she is? Even knowing, how dare you call her mad?" said Maran angrily.

"Now will you both shut your mouths or not? If the sound you're making is heard outside, all the trouble we've taken will go to waste. So until I speak, will you both be quiet?" Venthanar asked.

"Okay, Grandpa. Whatever you tell us, we'll do," both said.

"Look, Nandha, now I'm asking you again. Why did you kick your brother like that?"

"He innocently kicked as a joke, Grandpa. It's my fault that I beat him," said Maran.

"Look here, I'm telling you both about an important matter now. Your younger uncle's daughter is coming here tomorrow. Watch her too. There's something wrong with that family. Also, find out soon who this Samshika's father is. Until we find out, both of you should act like you're fighting," said Venthanar.

"Okay, Grandpa," both said together.

    subtitle: "Nandhan's Past Unveiled",
    content: `For a long time, the three of them talked, and realizing time had passed, Maran and his grandfather left Nandhan's room.

After they both left, Nandhan recalled his past life.

Nandhan had gone abroad from Poonsolai village to pursue his higher studies, and his life had gone normally for two years, calling home occasionally.

When Samshika entered his life, that's when his habits began to change. As the first sign of this, he stopped calling home. Even when they called, he wouldn't speak properly and would hang up immediately.

As days passed, Samshika gradually introduced him to habits like pubs and alcohol, which became his daily routine.

One day, intoxicated with alcohol and with the poison called Samshika who was with him, he lost his life, and that day, Saturday caught him.

At first, nodding to everything she said as his girlfriend, without knowing her true nature, he started a business in her name. In the midst of this, when Samshika became pregnant, he had to marry her.

Everything was going well, and after Yathra was born, when she was four years old, her true nature came to light.

She who was always secretly talking to her father, that day Nandhan had said he would return only in the evening for a business meeting, so she called her father and was discussing their next plan—that through Nandhan and Yathra, they should control the Agni Suli pooja of Shiva, which would be performed by the heir with the Surya mark of the Venthanar family. When Nandhan came back to get the file he had forgotten for the meeting, he heard everything.

Immediately, he moved from that place without leaving any trace, and hearing what she said, he went to the pub in anger and started drinking. What she said wasn't complete, so he didn't understand it. But he clearly understood that she had been pretending to be good with him only to take something from their family.

That whole night he stayed at the pub, and only the next morning did he come home.

Samshika talked to him as if she knew nothing. But Nandhan ignored her and called Yathra.

Yathra ran and hugged him.

He looked at Yathra's face. A child's face without deceit. Realizing that Samshika's thoughts weren't in her, he felt relieved.

But he didn't have the courage to confront Samshika. He didn't want to reveal the truth to her. So he isolated himself.

Whenever Samshika tried to get close to him, he moved away. After knowing her true nature, living with her disgusted him.

As days passed like this, he also reduced going home. He didn't know then who the heir with the Surya mark of the Venthanar family was. He thought he himself was that heir. But Samshika's plan threw him into great confusion.

This situation continued for four months, and his condition worsened from drinking. That's when he got a call from his mother. With some guilt, unable to talk much, he inquired about her well-being and hung up. In his mind, thinking, "I've made my family suffer all these days, I shouldn't stay here anymore."

Thinking that, he went home, and on the way home, he saw his love-wife going into a hotel intimately with another man.

Following them without their knowledge to see who she had come here with, he faced another humiliation—both of them went into a room and locked the door. Hearing from a nearby employee that both of them come here often, with disgust, he went straight to work on canceling their marriage.

After finishing all the work, Nandhan went home in the evening. There, his darling daughter at the beginning of five years, with an innocent face, was playing with the maid.

The one who thought all these days that she needed something from their family, that's why she lied and got close to him, and otherwise was truly married to him—today, after seeing the scenes before his eyes, was shattered.

He too is a man, isn't he? How long can he endure? Today itself, deciding to end everything and go to India immediately, Nandhan made his decision.

That night, he was waiting in the hall for her arrival.

Samshika entered the house. The moment she entered, seeing Nandhan there, she was about to go inside ignoring him when he stopped her saying "Stop!"

Looking at him as if asking "What?"

"Where have you been?" he asked calmly.

"I went out shopping with my friends," she said casually, and he gave her a slap in which his five fingers were imprinted on her cheek.

"Where you were, with whom, in which hotel, how long you were... I know everything!" he said with disgust.

Angry at that, Samshika, who had been acting all these days, when she realized everything about her was known to him, her true nature emerged and she started screaming.

At that sound, the child who was playing in the room came out and saw her parents fighting.

Their fight escalated and Nandhan hit her again, and Samshika angrily was leaving the house when it happened again.

Seeing her mother leaving the house, Yathra, crying "Mommy, where are you going? Don't leave me!" ran after her. He stopped and carried her.

"Princess, from now on Mommy won't come here. We're going to town," he said and took her to the room.

This was imprinted in the child's mind: "Because her father hit her, that's why her mother left her."

Two days passed, and Samshika talked to the child and plotted to enter the house. Meeting her at school and acting as if crying, the child also believed her.

So that evening, when Yathra cried and made a scene wanting her mommy, Nandhan also called Samshika and asked her to come home.

Samshika, elated that her plan had succeeded, entered the house looking at her husband contemptuously. But there, he was ready with big papers in hand, sitting with his leg crossed, looking at her with the same elation.

Seeing the change in his face, Samshika looked at him thoughtfully. He threw the paper in his hand at her face and said, "From now on, there's no relationship between you and me. You shouldn't set foot in this house anymore," and turned to go to his room carrying his daughter.

But Samshika snapped her fingers and called him, and he stood there without turning toward her.

Opening and looking at that paper, Samshika learned that he had used money to eliminate the husband-wife relationship between them in just two days.

Now money plays everywhere, with that same money, Nandhan had obtained the divorce. Seeing that, Samshika wasn't shocked, she took it casually.

"Where are you going? This house is in my name. You're in my house and telling me to leave? First, you get out of my house!" said Samshika.

He regretted his own foolishness of buying everything in her name in his love infatuation.

Then, going to his room, taking only what was necessary for him and Yathra, not even wanting to look at her face, with his crying daughter, he left that house.

Nandhan, who left the house, made all arrangements to go to India that very day and came to India.

But when he got off here, Sarathi was waiting for him as a taxi driver.

Soon after both of them got into Sarathi's car and sat down, they lost consciousness. Taking the unconscious people, Sarathi had taken them to a small village in Madurai.

After two hours, when Nandhan opened his eyes, sitting in a majestic pose in veshti and shirt directly opposite him was Maravarman.

Seeing him, Nandhan was shocked. "Who is he? Someone who looks exactly like him," wondering, Maravarman answered without being asked.

"What, brother, is it shocking? Don't be too shocked. I'm your brother. The same brother who they said died as a child—I'm Maravarman," he said with a smile, and Nandhan was shocked.

"You're alive? Then why did you make everyone believe all these years that you died?" Nandhan asked Maran with confusion.

"That... it's some hereditary secret. Grandfather and our younger uncle said that no one should know that I'm alive. That's why I've been hiding all these years. Even though I was hiding, I was monitoring you. But what I didn't expect was you getting married," he said, slightly curling his lips.

"When a girl suddenly comes and talks to you, won't you think about whether she's good or not? You nicely got caught in the trap she spread," Varman asked irritably.

What Maran said was humiliating to Nandhan. But what he says is true, isn't it! When Samshika first talked to him, he was captivated by her beauty. Not only her beauty, but knowing she was from Tamil Nadu pleased him very much. That's why he fell in love with her, married her, and had been living with a daughter for these five years. All of that was washed away like water in this one week.

"Okay, why talk about old stories? I need you to do something for me. That's why I brought you here," said Maran.

"What help do you need from me?" asked Nandhan.

"Until I tell you, you shouldn't leave this place and go anywhere. You should stay here in my place. I'm going to our palace in your place with our daughter Yathra," said Varman.

"Why do we need to do this? Can't we both just go to our house together? Why the impersonation?" asked Nandhan.

"Look here, there are many things you don't know. The moment you go there, your wife is going to come here. You definitely can't handle her.

The wife you've seen for these five years is different. After this, only her true nature will be revealed. You definitely can't handle it, so I have to go there in your place. Until then, you have to stay here," he said, leaving Sarathi and a woman named Seetha with him for help and security. Taking Yathra, who was still in deep unconsciousness, he went to his other house. Staying there with Yathra for a month and bonding well with her, only after that did Varman go to the Venthanar palace in Nandhan's name.

Thinking about everything that happened, Nandhan thought about Samshika, who had entered his house in the name of his child's "mother." He got angry. Yet, unable to show it outside, he stayed calm for the one reason Varman had said.

For some reason, Grandfather and Varman have been silent for all these years. He stayed calm for the sole reason that it shouldn't be ruined because of him.

    subtitle: "Moonlit Intimacy",
    content: `Night time, Varman's room was glowing in the soft light of electric lamps. Through the windows, the silver rays of the full moon filled the room. Mitrayazhini stood on the room's balcony, pondering over every incident that had happened since this morning.

This morning, she was ready to accept the groom her parents had chosen and receive the wedding necklace. When she learned it wasn't happening, her mind immediately accepted it normally. However, thinking about how not only did she marry him at first sight, but her heart also accepted him as her husband—she kept confusing her mind thinking about this.

One thing she didn't think about was Valavan's words: "I've united you with the one meant for you." If only she had thought about those words, she would have known right then that he was born for her.

As she was thinking about everything, Varman, eager to see his wife, opened the door and entered. First, he locked the door and scanned the room with his eyes, but saw only an empty room.

"Maybe she hasn't come from Pavithra's room yet," he thought and turned to leave the room again, when he spotted her on the balcony.

The white light of the full moon, the gentle pleasant breeze from the garden area caressing her hair—she stood there taking in all the beauty of the moon on her face. The rays of the full moon fell on her face, creating a divine glow. With long hair waving in the wind, with eyes reflecting the star clusters, Mitrayazhini stood motionless like a statue. In the stillness of the night, in the enchanting moonlight, she appeared like a painting to his eyes.

Mesmerized by her beauty for a moment, he then brought himself back to awareness and moved toward her, placing each step softly.

Lost in her thoughts, Mitra didn't even notice her husband standing behind her. Varman stood slowly behind her, and as her dark hair swayed in the wind and touched his face, its fragrance touched his very soul. That natural jasmine flower fragrance, her proximity, made his mind shiver. He had never felt such a fragrant sensation in his life. Forgetting himself in that fragrance, he wished that moment would stand still forever.

She had been standing lost in some thought for so long, and when she suddenly felt someone very close to her, she turned sharply. Seeing Varman standing very close behind her, she was startled for a moment and leaned back. He had bent and embraced her waist.

When he held her waist, the breeze had moved her saree aside, allowing his hand to touch her bare waist. When the warmth of his fingers touched her delicate skin, a kind of shiver spread throughout her body. Her mind, which had been confused until then, became emotional at that touch. Her soft waist fit completely within his grasp. The touch of his fingers created a new feeling within her. A thousand colors spread like a rainbow inside her. His gaze filled with love increased her shyness even more.

In that sudden touch, Mitrayazhini stood shivering as if electrified. There was a kind of tremor throughout her body. Her eyes, caught in the grip of his hands, looked at him. For a moment, both stood speechless, looking at each other. The longing in his eyes was too much for her to bear, so she closed her eyes tightly.

That silence spoke more emotions than words. Her act of closing her eyes seemed to accept his closeness. In the yearning of his many years of love, without knowing himself, Varman approached to kiss her. His eyes fixed on her lips, her lips and his lips came close to unite. The longing of many years, the yearning of many years, had been waiting for that one moment.

Their heartbeats sounded in unison. Both wished that moment would freeze forever. But to ruin that sweet moment, the door of the room where they were was knocked very forcefully.

In the closeness of love, he who had forgotten himself didn't hear the knocking on the room's door. But with the natural feeling inherent to femininity, Mitra realized herself and slowly opened her eyes, trying to gently move away from him. This action of hers brought Varman out of his trance.

Realizing his emotional action without having told her anything about himself yet, he immediately released her.

Slightly hesitant to look at her face, he attempted to say something to her. Before that, she said with some fear, "Some...one... is knock...ing... the door..." stammering, which he didn't quite understand.

While Varman was thinking that she was scared because he had approached her without her permission, the door of the room was knocked again, and only then did he understand that she was scared seeing the door being knocked. Thinking he could talk to her later, he turned and opened the door to see who it was. Pavithra was standing there anxiously.

Her anxiety itself indicated some problem, Varman understood and asked, "What happened?"

The anxiety on Pavithra's face also made Mitra, who was behind him, feel that it was some problem again.

"Brother, downstairs Yathra suddenly started acting strangely. No one can manage her. She won't even let Nandhan brother come near her. We're scared, please come down, brother," Pavithra said anxiously.

As soon as she said that, he quickly went downstairs. He knew very well whose work this was. So he quickly went down and went to Pavithra's room.

When he arrived there, everyone in the house was standing anxiously, while Sarvesh and Nandhan were holding Yathra, she was struggling in their hands. Everyone stood in fear wondering if a small child could be this violent. Pushing everyone aside, Varman approached Yathra.

Looking at Varman, Yathra kept saying, "I want my mommy... I want mommy."

"Let her go, both of you," Varman said firmly.

"Are you crazy? Right now she's not herself. Something has happened to my daughter, I'm scared," Nandhan panicked.

"I'm the one telling you to let the baby go! Let her go!" This time his voice sounded angry, and both immediately released Yathra.

As soon as they let go, the next moment she got down from the bed, pushed everyone aside, and ran out of the room quickly. Mitra came and stood in front of her.

As soon as she saw Mitra, her eyes waved, and Varman signaled Mitra with his eyes from behind Yathra to take her to the prayer room.

Understanding the message conveyed by his eyes, Mitra, unknowingly, gripped the child's hand tightly and dragged her to the prayer room.

Varman's mother and grandmother, seeing her do this, thought Mitra might do something to the child. Mangai and Mangalammaal panicked and went to stop Mitra.

"Stop right here! No one should move even one step from here. Until I come back," Varman stopped them and called Pragadeesh. "Go upstairs and lock Samshika's room so the sound doesn't reach," he said and walked in the direction Mitra had gone.

No one in the house understood how he was behaving, but they obeyed his words and stood quietly in the same place.

For Nandhan and his grandfather, one thing became very clear from Varman's actions: Samshika was the reason for Yathra's condition. Nandhan, seething with anger, struggled to control it. Noticing him, Venthanar gripped his hand tightly without anyone knowing and told him to remain calm.

"I'm scared! Please go and check. Both of them came to the hall, but we can't see them," Mangai complained to her husband.

Then Pragadeesh arrived and said, "Uncle, when I was locking their room, not only were they in the room, but someone else was also there. I couldn't understand what they were saying. But I heard them both talking."

"What are you blabbering? We were all in the hall, weren't we? How could someone else go into that room past us? Without observing anything properly, you come here and blabber! Everyone here is already scared about what's happening to the baby. With what you're saying, they'll be even more scared. Shut your mouth and stand quietly," said Sathiyan.

Then, from the direction of the prayer room, the child's screaming was heard loudly.

Everyone was shocked hearing the child's scream. Nandhan, hearing his child's cries, became distressed.

    content: `"Everyone here is already scared about what's happening to the baby. With what you're saying, they'll be even more scared. Keep your mouth shut and stand quietly," Sathiyan said angrily.

Then, from the direction of the prayer room, the child's screaming was heard loudly, and everyone rushed toward the prayer room in shock.

Only Nandhan, hearing his child's cries, stood frozen in the same spot. Noticing him, Sarvesh, knowing his brother's state of mind, took him along to the prayer room.

As everyone approached the prayer room, Varman was coming out of the prayer room carrying Yathra, and behind him, with a slightly frightened face and trembling hands, Mitra stood holding Varman's shirt.

"Varma, what happened to the baby?" Sathiyan panicked and went near him.

"Everyone wait in the hall for a minute. I'll put Yathra in Pavithra's room and come back," he said, carrying the child, and took two steps. Then Nandhan stood in front of him with pain in his eyes and outstretched hands.

Seeing something in his face, he immediately gave Yathra into his hands, and without anyone knowing, he pressed his hand and comforted him.

Nandhan took Yathra and instead of going to the room, he laid her on the sofa in the hall and looked at Varman. That look seemed to say, "I need to know what happened to my daughter."

Understanding that, Varman asked, "Pavithra, what suddenly happened? Why was Yathra behaving like that?"

"Brother, when we went to the room, she was fine at first. After some time, she said 'I want to go to mommy, take me along.' I said 'Mommy will come soon, until then let's play,' and Kavya and I distracted her and showed her games for a while."

"Then Pragadeesh uncle gave me sister-in-law Mitra's bag from your car, saying there was some sound coming from it, and asked me to check. When I opened the bag to see what sound it was, it was something like a watch. That's where the sound was coming from. Kavya took it from me and was trying to stop the sound. Then Yathra took something from sister-in-law's bag, threw it away, and started screaming. We tried to calm her down. But as if she was scared of seeing something, she kept screaming 'I want to go to mommy, let me go,' and hearing her voice, everyone came. When Nandhan brother and Sarvesh brother tried to hold Yathra, she was just screaming to get out of the room," Pavithra told everything.

"I knew from the beginning that she didn't seem like a good person looking at her. We let her into the house just because Varma tied the wedding necklace and brought her. But letting her into the house was a mistake. She must have tried to do something to my grandchild," Mangai said angrily.

Everyone was shocked to see that the person who had joyfully performed aarti and welcomed her inside when her son said this was his wife just a while ago, was now talking as if letting her into the house was a mistake. Varman looked at his mother's face without any emotion.

"Mangai, do you know what you're saying?" Sathiyan looked at his wife angrily.

"I'm saying everything knowingly! She must have tried to do something to my grandchild. That's what Pavithra said, 'The baby was scared after taking something from her bag.' Shouldn't that be obvious?" Mangai looked at Mitra with irritation.

"Daughter-in-law, what happened to you? Do you know what you're saying? You who have never spoken harshly, are now talking like this?" Mangalammaal asked.

"Everyone, will you be quiet for a moment?" Varman's voice sounded firmly in that hall, and everyone now looked at Varman.

"What are you using to say that my wife did something to your grandchild?" Varman asked his mother with a glare.

Mangai remained silent without answering Varman. "I'm asking you, answer me. If you don't like my wife, say it directly to her face. Don't try to drive her out of the house by unnecessarily blaming her. Now what did your daughter say? That Yathra was scared after seeing something from Mitra's bag, right? Pavithra, Yathra was scared after seeing something, you said, right? That object must be in your room, go get it," he told his sister, and Pavithra also immediately rushed to her room.

Mitra was watching everything that was happening there without any emotion. Her heart felt disgusted. She had already come here with a broken heart, thinking that everyone here would be comforting to her. It seemed to her that these people were much worse than them.

Nandhan clearly understood that his mother was unnecessarily creating a problem. But he also looked at his mother suspiciously, wondering why she was saying this.

Varman's mother looked at Mitra with disgust. Not wanting to stand there anymore, she thought of going to the room she was in a while ago. Because she couldn't leave the house, not just this town.

While coming in the car, Varman had told her a few things and made her swear that she should not leave the house under any circumstances. Not only that, he had said, "The lives of those in their house are in your hands." After saying that, how could she leave? So, as she turned to go to the room, understanding her intention, he tightly held her hand to prevent her from moving anywhere.

With tearful eyes, she looked up at her husband. "It's nothing, I'm here," he comforted her, and without anyone knowing, he told his grandfather to find the other person in Samshika's room.

Venthanar had been thinking about just that, standing quietly all this time. Now that his grandson also said so, he left from that place without anyone knowing, went to his room, called Kuberan on the phone, told him everything, and said, "Quickly find out who is in that room," and came back and stood with the others.

"What, Mangai, your speech is all coming out differently. Do you remember that I'm the eldest in this house?" he asked in a majestic voice. Until then, he had been quiet.

Everyone looked at him a bit differently because he had been quiet all these days and suddenly Mangai's voice was sounding different from usual.

Then Pavithra came from her room and gave the envelope she had brought to her brother Varman, and he opened it to see what it was.

Inside were temple kumkum and Shiva's rudraksha beads. Seeing it, Varman showed it to his mother with a smile, and not only she but everyone there looked to see what it was, and seeing the kumkum and rudraksha in it, everyone looked at Mangai's face.

But Varman, at the sound that came to his phone, took it out and looked at it—his face had such radiance. The happiness of finding a treasure he had been searching for many days. He immediately called Pragadeesh softly and told him to take all the young ones and immediately go to the Shiva temple.

"Why?" Pragadeesh looked as if asking.

"Do as I say," he said, and also told him to take Nandhan and Yathra along with them.

"Grandfather, let the young ones go outside for a bit. Until then, let's talk privately," Varman said.

Understanding his intention, he nodded with a smile, and the next moment, all the young heirs of the house left the palace and went to the Shiva temple. As Pragadeesh was leaving, he told him, "Don't leave the temple under any circumstances, especially Yathra shouldn't come out," and sent them off.

Mangai, though suspicious about suddenly sending all the young ones to the temple, thought "They shouldn't know about me," and tried to approach Mitra to apologize to her. Then her eldest son came and stood in front of her, blocking her.

"The habit of blaming others hasn't left you yet, it seems," he said looking at Mangai. She was shocked hearing it.

"Varma, what are you saying?" asked Chandra Venthan, who had been standing quietly all this time.

He too didn't like some qualities of his sister-in-law. He had told his wife about it too. But now hearing what Varman said, he thought Varman definitely knows something about his sister-in-law. That's why he's asking like this.

But Mangai's husband, who should have been shocked and panicked, stood calmly without any emotion.

Mitra, Vasanthi, Prabavathi, Mangalammaal were standing there watching, not understanding anything that was happening.

"Hey, what uncle, why are you in such a hurry? It seems you also know about them," Varman looked at him sharply. He didn't give any answer. In that itself, Varman understood.

"You don't know about me fully. If they speak a little calmly and affectionately, you might believe them. But I will never believe you," he looked at his mother with disgust.

At the same time, Kuberan, who had gone to the room next to where Samshika was staying, went through the balcony and through the window of the room where Samshika was, recorded a video of those inside using a selfie stick, and sent it to Varman's phone.

    content: `"The habit of blaming others hasn't left you yet, has it, mother?" he said, emphasizing 'mother' slightly, which shocked Mangai.

With the same shock, Mangai looked at her son, and her son was also looking at her. "You don't know about me fully. I will never trust people who are very affectionate toward me. If they speak a little calmly and affectionately, you might believe them. But I will never believe you," he looked at his mother with disgust.

"Varma, now is not the time to talk about that. We should go to the temple immediately," said Varman's grandfather, Venthanar.

"No, grandfather, we have to talk now. Because only if those in the house know about them, they will stay away from them," Varman told his grandfather and looked at his father.

"What, Mr. Sathyaventhan? Will you tell about your wife yourself? Or should I tell?" he asked, and Sathyaventhan looked at his son with pain in his eyes.

"Looking like this, what can I do? You have to tell," he said and sat on the sofa there with his wife. Everyone looked at Sathyaventhan with confusion, "What?"

He too took a big breath and said, "Twenty years ago, it was Mangai who murdered Valli and the child in her womb," and everyone there was shocked. That matter was already known to Venthanar and Varman, so they didn't show shock hearing it.

Mitra screamed in shock, "What... murder?"
No one even noticed her screaming in shock. Everyone was frozen in shock to that extent.

"I learned this truth only a few years ago," he said, and Mangai glared at her husband angrily.

"So is it really true that Valli is not alive?" Vasanthi asked in shock.

Sathyaventhan nodded as if to say "No."

Valli was Mangai's own elder brother Athikesavan's wife.

A few years ago,

Mangai's father Janarthanan, mother Vadivukarasi. In Melaiyur village, their family, like Venthanar's family, was a traditional family.

This couple had two sons and one daughter.

First son Perumal, his wife Rama. Four years after marriage, they still don't have children.

Second son Athikesavan was studying in another town and working there. Today they have asked him to come to the village to see a girl for him.

Third daughter Mangai. Being the only female heir in that house, Janarthanan had blind love for her. If his daughter wished for anything, he would never refuse. That's how, when she saw the rich, educated Sathyaventhan from the neighboring village, Mangai liked him very much. Since they were already relatives, he got Mangai married to Sathyaventhan.

Nine years had passed since Mangai's marriage. She had twin sons, Maravarman and Nandhavarman. Both were turning eight.

Today, since they were going to see a girl for Janarthanan's second son Athikesavan, everyone at the Melaiyur palace was getting ready excitedly. Then a car came and stopped at the palace entrance, and from it, Mangai, her father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband, and their sons all got out.

"Father, has brother come?" Mangai entered the house with the question.

"Not yet, dear," her father told his daughter, and with a smile, invited his son-in-law and his parents inside Janarthanan.

After a brief pleasantry exchange inside, Sathyaventhan asked, "What uncle, we still haven't seen brother-in-law?"

"That's the thing, we don't know, son-in-law. There's still one hour of good time left. We still haven't seen Kesavan," he said and called his son again. When the phone didn't go through this time too, he got a bit anxious and told his elder son to go check.

He too called his younger brother's friend and inquired. They said Athikesavan had already left for the village, and he told this to his father.

Only after hearing that did Janarthanan feel a bit relieved. Then they heard the car sound outside. Just from the car sound, they knew who had come, and went outside with faces blooming after six months.

The joy of that couple eagerly awaiting their son was wiped away in an instant.

Because Athikesavan didn't come alone. Standing with him was his eight-month pregnant wife Valli.

"Father, forgive me. I got married without your knowledge due to circumstances," Athikesavan said, and Janarthanan silently entered the house without saying anything.

Perumal was the one who shouted about family honor and respect, and Sathyaventhan pacified him and took him inside.

As everyone went inside without inviting them into the house in anger, Varman was the one who invited his uncle and his wife inside.

When those who entered inside, no one said anything to them. Not wanting his father to be humiliated, Perumal called the girl's house, told them everything, and apologized.

Venthanar said, "The boy got married as he wished, accept them, Sambandhi."

"No, Sambandhi. If he had told this matter earlier, I wouldn't have looked for a girl for him. Now look, because of what he did, I have to bow my head in front of them," Janarthanan said with pain.

Then Perumal arrived and said, "Father, don't think about anything and worry. I spoke to them," and then said, "I have some work, I'll go out and come back," and glared at his brother and left from there.

Everyone was normal, only Mangai kept looking at Valli thoughtfully.

After a while, the Venthanar family talked and went to their house, and Athikesavan took his wife to his room.

Vadivukarasi, noticing that Perumal who went out hadn't returned even after night fell, told her husband and worried. Without giving any answer, Janarthanan lay down quietly.

Perumal, who came home at 11 pm at night, without anyone knowing, placed the object in his hand in the store room there and went to his room.

Two weeks passed quietly. As Valli's eight months were completed and the ninth month started, Vadivukarasi told her husband that they should perform the valakappu ceremony in the ninth month and introduce the younger daughter-in-law to the village.

What his wife said also seemed right, so he also agreed to perform the valakappu.

Since Valli had no family, Sathyaventhan said he would act as Valli's brother and do everything, and Athikesavan and Valli were overjoyed.

During that intervening period, Varman got very attached to Valli. He touched and touched the child in her womb and was delighted.

Nandhan didn't associate much with Athi, so he wouldn't come to their house. But Varman liked his uncle Athi more than his elder uncle, so he had great love for his wife and the child growing in her womb, staying in their house with them.

There were two more days for the valakappu. Everyone was sleeping that day, when Varman suddenly woke up.

Everywhere was dark. Looking at his uncle and aunt sleeping beside him, he got up silently, feeling a bit hungry. Remembering the ice cream he had bought in the evening, eager to eat it, he came out of the room.

Then he saw his elder uncle entering the house with wet clothes and going into the store room. Wanting to call "Uncle," he wanted to frighten and play with his uncle, so he went to the room he had gone to without making a sound, slowly opened the door, and shouted "Uncle." Seeing the event that happened there, he screamed in fear and fainted on the spot.

Athikesavan, who was sleeping well, woke up hearing Varman's sound. "What... it sounded like Varman screamed? He was sleeping right here, wasn't he?" he wondered and came out of the room without disturbing his wife. There, directly opposite, he saw his brother carrying Varman and going outside.

"Brother, what happened to Varman?" he went quickly to him, and he, not expecting him there at that time, was shocked.

Everything was just a few moments. Immediately not showing his shock, he said, "I went to Madurai town and just came back, Kesava. It rained on the way. So I got a bit wet. The light wasn't on, so when he saw me, he got scared and fainted. So I picked him up to take him to the hospital."

Athikesavan also believed what he said. "Okay, leave it, brother. He must have fainted in fear. Otherwise, there's nothing. Give him to me," he said and took Varman in his hands. Going up the stairs to his room carrying him, he suddenly turned and looked at his brother. He left from there without saying anything.

Perumal, watching both of them leave, with some anxiety on his face, went to his room. "What next? Varman saw him, didn't he?" he panicked and decided on a course of action, and slept that night having made a decision.

The next day, according to Perumal's plan, Varman fell from the mountain and died. But that blame fell on Nandhan.

    content: `"What to do now? Varman even saw me, didn't he?" Perumal panicked a bit, deciding that if he remained alive, nothing they thought would happen. Having made that decision, he slept that night.

Accordingly, the next morning, everyone at Janarthanan's house were seated at the dining table.

Just then, Varman woke up from sleep and came out of the room, went straight to his uncle Athikesavan. "Uncle, I want to go home, please take me there and drop me," he said, looking at his elder uncle with fear. Both his uncles who were watching him noticed this.

"Why is he afraid looking at brother? Brother's behavior last night wasn't right either. I thought I'd talk to Varman today, but he's asking to be dropped home," he thought. "Okay, I can talk to him in the car on the way," he thought and nodded yes to what Varman said.

"Kesava, I also have some work to talk to Mangai about. I'll come with you," Perumal said, looking at Varman.

Hearing what Perumal said, Athikesavan knew very well that something was not right with his brother. Yet, because he let it pass casually saying "Let's see," it would later become a very big problem—he himself couldn't have imagined.

No matter how much Valli and Vadivukarasi said, Varman, not wanting to stay there, insisted on going to his house immediately. Without even letting Athikesavan eat properly, he took him along.

Perumal also went behind them.

Even at eight years old, Varman, having shrewd intelligence like a cheetah, knowing why his uncle was following them, didn't sit near him in the car but sat beside his uncle Athikesavan.

In a short while, all three reached the Venthanar palace. At that morning time, everyone was sitting at the dining table eating. Mangai was the first to see them.

"Brother, come brother. Why did you suddenly come without saying or calling?" Mangai approached both her brothers with a smile. Their beloved son, without looking at anyone, ran quickly to his room.

Venthanar looked at Varman's action without understanding.

"What brother, the one who refused to come even when I called yesterday, has gotten up and come this morning," Mangai said laughing.

"Don't know, dear. As soon as he woke up from sleep, he insisted on going home, only one insistence. He didn't even let me eat breakfast," Athikesavan said.

"Okay, come inside both brothers. Let's eat," Mangai invited, and they too sat down to eat.

Everyone was eating normally, but Perumal alone kept looking at the upstairs.

Athikesavan was just observing each of his brother's actions.

To divert Athikesavan's attention, Mangai was the one who spoke. "Aunt, uncle, I told you yesterday, right? Today I said I was going to Kunrakudi Murugan temple. Vasanthi and I will go and come back."

"Okay, dear, go and come. You shouldn't go alone. Sathyan, Chandra, you too take the children and go together as a family," said Venthanar.

They too said okay and prepared to go to the temple.

Kesavan and Perumal, who had been talking for a while, said Kesavan should leave as it was getting time. Perumal, who had been expecting Varman to come down, when he didn't seem to be coming down, thought, "They're all going to the temple. I can deal with him there," and left with his brother.

At 10 o'clock, everyone except Bapaa and Paati left for the temple.

Here, Kesavan was driving the car thoughtfully. "Kesava, stop the car for a bit. I have some work at our farm," said Perumal.

As Kesavan was also in some thought, he stopped the car. Perumal got down from it and said he would come home himself in the afternoon, and left from there.

Kesavan too said okay and left with the car. Perumal, who stood looking at the farm until the car left, as soon as the car disappeared, took out his phone, told another car to come, and in the next two minutes, left for Kunrakudi.

Here, Varman's family all reached Kunrakudi Murugan temple in one hour. Perumal had come before them and was waiting in a secluded spot.

Those who went inside the temple finished all their prayers in a short time and were sitting in the temple sanctum talking, the elders. All the children were playing a little away from them. Only Varman was sitting very quietly near the elders, watching the children play.

"Hey Varma, why are you so quiet since coming from uncle's house? Did they scold you? Did you come back because of me?" his father asked, but he remained quiet without giving any answer.

Looking at his face, his father Sathyaventhan thought, "Someone at that house must have scolded him, so he came back angry," and said, "Look here, Varma, you shouldn't take everything the elders say the wrong way. Go, go and play with them."

He too said okay and went to play with the children.

In a short while, forgetting everything else, he was playing busily with the children when he saw his uncle Perumal looking at him. Shocked at seeing him, everything that happened last night came to his mind. Slightly scared, he suddenly ran toward where he had seen him. Nandhan also ran behind him.

Seeing both children suddenly running, Mangai too went near them saying "Something's wrong."

By then, everything was over.

Perumal, seeing Varman running, hid himself in a way that the boy couldn't see him from the side. When Varman came near him, without noticing Nandhan and his mother coming behind him, he pushed Varman down from the mountain and tried to move from there. Then a voice from behind him, "Brother!" made him turn back in shock. There, Nandhan was running fast looking at Varman. Not noticing the stone below, he stumbled and fell down. His head was hit hard, and he fainted falling down, both from the heavy bleeding and the fear of seeing Varman fall from the mountain.

The person who came first slapped his brother. "You sinner! You unjustly killed my son!" he kept asking while beating him repeatedly. By then everyone had come there hearing the sound.

Those who came there were shocked to see Nandhan lying in a pool of blood. The next moment, they took him and admitted him to the nearby hospital. Meanwhile, no one even checked if Varman was with them or not.

While Nandhan was being treated inside, everyone else was standing in front of that room saying, "What happened to Nandhan?"

Then Perumal, who was sitting alone and crying, took his sister away and said, "Mangai, forgive me. I had no other way than this. Varman knew all our secrets. Even though he's a small boy, you know about his horoscope, right? He has great intelligence. So, if he tells everything to those in the house, we'll get caught with the family. That's why I pushed him down from the mountain," he said, and Mangai was shocked.

"What... what are you saying?"

"Yes, dear. Last night I was performing puja and Varman saw it. He even saw me directly offering the sacrifice. Seeing that, he fainted right there. But when he woke up in the morning, he acted normally as if nothing happened. That's what scared me a bit. I knew then. With his intelligence, he must have stayed quiet thinking to somehow expose our secret. Also, he tried to tell Kesavan right away. I was there, so he couldn't tell. Even after this, if we leave him, definitely the hardship our family has suffered all these years will all go to waste. You leave this problem as it is, I'll take care of it," he said.

"But brother, he's my born son. How can I forget what happened in front of my eyes?" she cried. He consoled her saying this and that and brought her to where everyone was.

Just then, Vasanthi asked, "Varman is nowhere to be seen?" and everyone became anxious again. Then Mangai looked at her brother, and he said with his eyes, "I'll take care of it," and turned to everyone and said, "When Varman and Nandhan were fighting in play and when Nandhan pushed Varman, Varman lost his footing and fell down the mountain. I've told our people to search fully," he said without any hesitation. Everyone who heard what he said stood shocked.

Mangai, though saying her brother did this heinous act to save their secret, was crying in pain knowing who killed her born son but not being able to tell. Everyone there thought she was crying thinking about Varman. But only Mangai knows why she is crying. She's crying thinking of sacrificing her own son to save her birth home's secret. Such a mother.

Hearing what Perumal said, all the men immediately left from there and searched for five hours around the place where Varman was said to have fallen. But they couldn't find Varman anywhere. Finally, only Varman's torn shirt came into their hands.

At the same time, in the forest area of Poonsolai village, in the Shiva temple that only the Venthanar lineage has been worshipping for many years, Athikesavan, Valli, and Varman were standing in fear, while in front of them, a man-sized black king cobra stood with its hood raised.

    content: `Hearing what Perumal said, Satyavendan and Chandravendan asked their son Perumal to take care of everything at the hospital and left the hospital where Nandan had been admitted. 

The police were informed and picked up and searched for five hours around the spot where Varman was said to have fallen. No matter how hard they searched, they could not find Varman anywhere. In the end, all they got was Varman's torn shirt. 

The police also announced, "After falling down such a big hill, the child will not be alive. Your child is dead," and left. Neither of the men expected this event at all. 
Those who were worried seeing Nandan in that state, could not even imagine that Varman was not alive now. 

They could not bear the fact that the eldest heir of their house, "This is the one born to protect your dynasty", who had amazed the household, was no longer alive. 

Here in the hospital Perumal was sitting a little nervous. "Where will those who have gone find and save Varman?" He was afraid. He was thinking, "If only he comes alive, everything that has been suffered for so many years will be in vain." 

At that time, Satyavendan and Chandravendan stood in front of Perumal with tired faces. Seeing both of them, everyone got up and eagerly looked at them, seeing the confusion in their eyes and the torn clothes of Varman in their hands, everyone understood the matter. The women screamed without looking at the hospital. Even children say, “What?” Without knowing that, they cried seeing their mother crying. Deivaprakash made them all quiet by showing them children. 

At the same time, seeing that Nandan had not closed his eyes for so long, he said to the others, "Where will this man leave them?" As he was sitting holding his life in his hand, Vendanar and his wife came there after getting the information. As time passed, Nandan did not wake up. 

“If everyone is here, who will do what Varman has to do?” Deivaprakash told Mangai to stay near Nandan and took everyone home. 

Even before they reached home, the village had already assembled at Vendanar Palace. Varman was dead and everyone was doing things for him. But Varman was sitting alive next to his maternal uncle and his wife in the oldest Shiva temple in the town. 

A while back, "When Perumal got out of the car, Adikesavan took the car and had not gone a short distance. By then, he was looking thoughtfully at the phone call from his wife and was confused by what Valli said on that side. 

"What do you mean? Tell me patiently without crying. What would I think if he suddenly called me and told me to save Varuman?” he asked. 

"What, don't ask me anything now. I am now in the Shiva temple in the forest of your village. You immediately go to Kunrakkudi Murugan Temple. Varmanoda's life is in danger. Moreover, no one should ever know that he is still alive.” 

“Somehow you save Varman and bring him to my place. We will leave this town immediately. Every minute that we are in this town, our child's life and Varman's life are in danger," before she could say it fully, the phone was disconnected. 
However, Adikesavan, who did not ignore his wife's insistence, immediately took the car and left for Kunrakkudi. Adi Kesavan saw his brother on the way. 

"What is he doing here? He got out of the car saying that he had work in the garden. Where are you going in another car now?” Thinking that, he felt connected to something that his brother's actions were different from yesterday and that now his wife was saying “Varman's life is in danger”. Immediately, he secretly followed his brother. 

In pursuit of his brother, Adikesava learned what he was about to do and saved Varman just in time.

When Perumal pushed Varman down, he didn't even look to see if he fell or not. Varman's good timing was hanging in the gap, only to catch his leg on a tree branch as he fell. God had thought that his life should not end so quickly, and in those ten minutes when he was throbbing in pain, Adikesavan came there to save him. 

Immediately, he saved Varman who was hanging from the tree and the next minute left from Kunrakkudi to his wife's place. Valli stood there for a long time with his full stomach panting for them. It was only after seeing Varman come with her husband that he could breathe well. 

Adikesavan quickly approached his wife, "Valli, what is the matter? How did you know that Varman's life was in danger? What are you doing here?" He asked nervously. 

"What, I want to talk to you about something important," Valli started, then a black dragon with a man at the gate of the temple stood in front of the three of them, and the three of them started fighting. 

They say, "Snake means the army trembles." But who would not be afraid of a snake standing here as tall as a man? Even Adikesavan, not knowing what to do for a moment, stood hugging his wife and son-in-law. 

Suddenly an old man appeared from the darkness of the Shiva temple. His eyes flashed with wisdom and he smiled at the dragon. 

"Fear not! This dragon has not come to kill you. Rather, Lord Shiva has sent you to protect you and your heirs." 

“He was blessed by Lord Shiva at birth. His future is as lofty as that of Islam. He is chosen by Shiva. He has many enemies. But there is no destruction forever,” he said and smiled. 

“This dragon has come here to protect you,” he said, and the dragon disappeared. 

After thinking about something for a while, Adikesavan ordered his wife and son-in-law, "Not to go anywhere outside the temple until I come here," and left the temple. 

Even then, "What, I want to talk to you about something important. Just listen to me for a minute,” Valli said and hurried out of the temple, bypassing Siddhar who was going ahead of him. 

Someone who had already thought that Kesavan would come to see him, smiled softly at him and said, “I know why you have come to me. I will tell you only one thing. The eldest female heir of your family will come through you. If your son-in-law is an aspect of Shiva, your daughter is an aspect of Parvati. Even if their circumstances change and take them to different sides, life will bring them together. Then you will meet your daughter again. Until then your daughter cannot be seen in your eyes. Go to your birthplace now. Your father's life is swinging,” a few more things that he had not even thought of and went away with so many mysteries. 

Adikesavan was shocked when he heard what Siddhar said. His statement that the child inside his wife and his son-in-law were all aspects of Shiva made Adikesavan think. But at that time, the only thought in his mind was to protect his father. So he left that place. Little did he know that that day would be the last time he would see his wife, unborn child and son-in-law. 

At the same time, Satyavendan was performing all the rituals as a father, saying that Varman had died. It was then that he noticed that Kesavan and his father Janardhan were not there, asked his brother where they were and asked Perumal saying that he did not know either, he said “I will take care” and moved a bit to call his brother, saying that it was also switched off. 

Whoever had called him left his wife and son-in-law alone and came home to see what had happened to his father. At that time, some raiders entered the temple to find the whereabouts of Valli and kill him, when a dragon stood in front of them as their bulwark.

At the sight of the Aluyar Naga, the raiders ran away, and Valli suddenly went into labor. Valli doesn't know what to do when he, who is now in his ninth month, suddenly starts having pain. Seeing his aunt writhing in pain, little Varman doesn't know what to do. 

Varman also placed his hand on his aunt's stomach and cried, "Father, aunty, don't make them cry." 

Isn't Varman a small child, so he doesn't know what to do when he sees his aunt crying. The only thing he knows at his age is that his papa is in his aunt's womb. That was all he knew. 

Although the pain stopped for a while, the pain started again. At that time, some women from the neighboring village who had come to collect firewood in that forest heard the noise and came to see. When they arrived there, the dragon they were guarding had disappeared from the place. So when the women came to that place, they saw a little boy and a woman with a full belly. As soon as they saw it, they understood that it was labor pains and immediately thought that it would not be right to be there. They took Valli by the hand at the crossroad they had come to and when they were trying to cross the border of the town, Valli, whatever he thought in his mind, immediately took the shirt of a woman's child who was there in pain and put the shirt that Varman was wearing on the child. 

Then, he removed the heirloom of their house from his neck and placed it in his hand. All the women present noticed Valli's behavior and understood the danger for both of them. So they immediately left the place without delay and brought him to a small hospital in that town. 

In Valli's mind, there was only the thought of "somehow to save her child." 

Because only he knows who this child is important to. For that sole reason, she decided not to have her child in this town and tried to tell her husband. But Adikesavan, who did not see it at all, said that he was coming after talking to Siddha. He did not even come back to see them and forgot about the rest when he heard that his father's life was in danger.

    subtitle: "Continuity",
    content: `Valli's only thought was to "save her child somehow." 
Adikesavan and Valli's penitent daughter was born amidst many struggles, leaving Valli in the delivery ward while everyone waited outside. 

After the birth of the child, Valli went into unconsciousness and the new born child was first given to Varman as per Valli's wish. An eight-year-old boy doesn't even know how to hold a baby. Varman carried his baby in his arms for the first time as the two women by his side told him how to hold the baby. 

He had such an ecstasy at that young age. All the way Valli was brought to the hospital, Valli told him only one thing, that he would have to take care of the baby girl who was going to be born in his womb for the rest of his life. Apart from that, she also took an oath from him that no one should know that she and the unborn child were alive. He already knew that he was going to die...though he didn't want to put up with his pain and tell the boy everything, but he matured him by telling him everything, thinking that someone with more intelligence would understand. 

The boy who had gone to the brink of death understood everything. "Even if he goes home alive, his uncle will plan to kill him again," he understood even at that young age. 

So, keeping his aunt's words in mind, he decided at that early age, "These are the only people in his life." 

But what if he made up his mind? There is a rule, isn't there? It is waiting to tear their family apart. 

The first play of fate was that Varman died while he was still alive and all the rituals were performed by his father's hands. Here is his destiny waiting to hold the next event. 

Valli woke up half an hour after the baby was born. Beside him, his son-in-law Varman was sitting on one side and his beloved daughter was fast asleep on the other side. As he thought, a female heir was born to them. He had already predicted it. However, just as he was thinking about how to save his child after this, he heard someone shouting outside. At that sound he knew who had come. 

In the same hospital Lakshmi was admitted for delivery in the bed next to Valli (Mitra's foster mother). 

When there was no one at home, the pain came and he could not stand above one level and fainted and fell down. When she fell down, Lakshmi hit her stomach and started bleeding there. The family took him to the hospital after a quarter of an hour after he fell down. The baby was stillborn after being hit in the stomach when it fell down. While Lakshmi was unconscious, her husband Annadurai, Lakshmi's mother Sundari and her son were watching to see when she would wake up. 

At that time, one of the women of the village who came in from another side of the general maternity ward, said, "Inda girl, someone has come looking for you. You can tell by looking at them, they are some kind of rowdy. I doubt it because of what you have done in the forest. Now they are making trouble by saying that they have come looking for a girl. I suspect that you are the one they are looking for." It was understood that Valli called the nurse who was examining Sundari in the bed next to him and pleaded with tears, "Please save my baby somehow ma'am." 

"What are you talking about? If you told us to save the child without saying anything, what would we think? We know very well that something is going on outside. But what can we do without knowing what the problem is?" 

Annadurai, who came near them, said, "I heard what that girl was saying. I think that they are trying to get this girl and that child to do something."

Despite all the trouble, Varman was holding the child's hand and looking at her face. He was looking at the child's face without taking his eyes off the face of the child as he knew beforehand that "If you leave her now, you will never see her again." 

Then Valavan came near him and gently touched the child's cheek to make him look like a doll. 

"Hey, that's my sin. Untouchable," said Varman, patting Valavan's hand. 

Just by his voice, I remembered that Varman was now by his side. Not knowing what to do with it, Valli said with tears in her eyes, "Varma, run away from this place as soon as possible. Don't you run away from them." 

“Aunty, I will never leave you and papa.” said stubbornly, 

"Sonna don't understand. They don't know that you are alive. You are not a little boy. You will be nine years old. Do you understand what I am saying? Please come and join you with your father. Now escape from this place," he called the woman who was there and said, "Send this one away from here without them knowing," and sent Varman with them. 

As Varman also left the place, he turned back and looked at the child's face. 

"These are the only people in his life," he thought, and in a few seconds, everything flew away from his life. 

At that time, Lakshmi, who was in the bed next to her, woke up and asked her mother, "Where is my child?" He was shouting. Hearing that, Valli immediately called Annadurai, who was there, took her child in her arms, kissed the child's face with tears and felt the pain of dying inside. We will not come and celebrate the girl as our own. From now on, she is only your daughter," said Valli, handing over her daughter. She couldn't help but think how many dreams she and her husband had for their unborn child, all shattered by that one person. 

Annadurai also asked, "What happened now?" He was startled for a minute. 

He thought, "There is some danger for them. So he will tell them to save them." But Annadurai never imagined that he would give the child in his hand and say, "This is your daughter." 

As far as that memory was concerned, it was Lakshmi's cry that brought it back. Annadurai, who looked at Valli with troubled eyes, looked at him with a feeling of gratitude, turned and approached his weeping wife, gave the child in his arms to her, and said, "Our child," said Manamarak. When he said, he thought, "Now this is his daughter". But he failed to think if his wife would think of him as a daughter after knowing all the truth. 

Whoever is not happy there, Valavan is very happy. As soon as he saw the child, who was the embodiment of beauty like the crescent moon, Valavan fell in love with him. Its tiny arms and legs and soft fluffy cheeks did something to him. Varman was upset because he had scolded him for touching the child some time ago. But "No one can say anything about her from now on. From now on she will stay in our house," Valavan was looking at the child with a full face of joy. 

Lakshmi's face was so happy after buying the baby. "Where did something happen when he fell down and something happened to his child?" The person who had been protesting for so long was so happy when he found out that nothing happened to his child and that she was fine. 

"After all, isn't it the first child? Everyone will treasure it?"

Lakshmi's mother Sundari also knew that “the child is dead”. Suddenly he saw with shock that his son-in-law had come with a child in his arms. When he came to ask something, Annadurai said to his mother-in-law with his eyes, "I will tell you later", he saw Valli, who was sitting next to his wife and caressing the baby, looking at them on the bed next to him. In his hand was Lakshmi's baby which the nurse had given him. 

He had tears in his eyes but a smile on his face. "Even if she is no more, her child will not be an orphan," the mother felt relieved. He remembered what had happened in the house since morning, and he knew from the voice that said, "It is impossible to meet her husband anymore." That is why he has shown that he decided everything immediately and implemented it. 

At that time, the person responsible for Valli's condition entered the room where Valli was. If you think it's great to have arrived, it's not. The one who has come is more dangerous than Perumal. After seeing the truth about him with her own eyes, Valli decided that it was definitely not possible for her to be alive anymore. Valli had already predicted that he would know everything about himself in an instant. But Valli didn't expect him to approach her so soon. 

Just as Valli thought, the man who had heard about Valli's labor pains and was admitted to the hospital and planned to kill Valli to take away the child who was going to be born the next moment, had changed his appearance and came there with two robbers. 

The person who came in first went near the child. "When will he come?" Valli, who had expected that, was looking at the person who had come with such murderous passion. 

"What do you want? You won't be waiting for me here?" He laughed. 

"I expected it. But what, I didn't expect you so soon," he said with a smile. 

"No need to cut words. You know why I have come here," said the person who approached Valli, went near the child and lifted the child. As soon as it was picked up, it became clear that it was not a girl, but a boy. 


"How did this happen? It's impossible!" He asked in shock. 

He smiled slightly at him, and the face of the person who saw that smile was so cruel. Annadurai could clearly see the cruelty on his face. 

He walked around for a while, thinking something, "Tell me the truth, you gave birth to a girl? Are you trying to deceive me?" He said murderously. 

Although he was a little startled by what he heard, he immediately braced himself up and said, "Don't talk unnecessarily. I am in agony because my child has died. Don't increase my suffering by talking like this," he said with a real pain on his face to part with his daughter. 

"How long have you been left alive for the sake of this child that will come through you. But how could my prediction be wrong? You should have given birth to a girl child? How come a boy child was born? That too, the child was not alive and was stillborn! How is this possible?" He mumbled something, and when no one noticed, he put the poison needle in his hand into his glucose bottle. 

The person who stayed in the room for a while said, "If he is still here after this, he will be suspected that he is not there," and immediately left the place. 

With the thought "Valli will not be alive anymore". 

Similarly, in the next five minutes after he left the room, the doctors could not save Valli even though they struggled to breathe a little bit. Even at the moment of his death, Valli died looking at his daughter and the chain of inheritance that was the memory of his son-in-law in his hand. 

At the same time, Adikesavan came to the town in search of his father, and everyone who saw him in the town came to console him saying "Varman is dead". 

He hurried to his house without noticing any of them. No matter how fast he went, there was no one in such a big house and Janardhanan was lying dead in the hall.

    content: `Leaving his wife and son-in-law alone, Adikesavan rushes into the house to save his father's life, when he sees his father lying lifeless and stops at the same spot. 

For a minute he didn't know what to do. Seeing his father's condition, even his eyes were disturbed. He turned his eyes on all four sides, but not a single person was visible to his eyes. Guilty that he could not save his father despite coming so quickly, he sat down in front of his father's dead body and stared at his face. He didn't even know how long he had been sitting. As everyone in the house heard of Varman's death and was in the Vendanar palace, Janardhana's condition was still unknown to anyone there. 

Then his cell phone showed its presence to distract him from his memory. Being in the forest for so long, his cell phone did not have a tower. 
He came out of his memory at the sound of the phone ringing and it was Vendar who had called him to pick up the phone. Just then, the man who hit himself on the head 'for not telling others this news' accepted the invitation. 

"What are you asking, where are you? How many times have you tried to call your phone since morning? Your phone won't go away. Where have you been?" 

"Uncle, listen carefully to what I am saying. This is very important." 

When Kesavan said that, Vendana frowned slightly and looked around. He said. 

"Uncle, Varman is not dead as you think. He is alive. But, no one should know that he is alive. A lot of things are happening here without our knowledge. I can't tell you anything completely now," said Kesavan while he was talking, "Kesava!" A voice was heard from the door of the house. 
Shaken by it, he dropped the cell phone in his hand and it shattered. 

Perumal also did not listen to everything Adikesavan said. He heard only one last word spoken. So Perumal did not know that Varman was alive. 

Adikesavan was shocked to see Perumal standing there saying "Brother". 

He knew very well, "He who saw Varman killed must have killed his father," he came out of shock, immediately went to his brother and grabbed his shirt, "Are you a human being? Not only did you see Varman killed, but also killed my father?" He asked angrily. 

When Kesavan heard what he said, 'How did he know the truth? Even without that, he will say that I have killed my father,' said the shocked one, as if he did not know anything, "Kesava, what are you talking about? I think you are talking about something wrong," Perumal came close to him to see what had happened to his father. 

"He won't go near me. Is my father such a murderous boy? I can't even imagine. How much affection did he have for you? How could you have the heart to kill him?" 

"Kesava, don't talk like a madman. How can I try to kill our father?" 

"Don't act too much. I know all the truth. You have not been acting well since Neth. I was also watching you. I thought there was some problem. But I never thought you would go to the extent of killing Varman," while he was talking, someone hit Adikesavan from behind with an iron rod, and the next second he went unconscious. He fainted before he saw who hit him. 

When he saw his brother passed out, he was shocked and asked, "Who hit him?" When he saw the person standing there, he was even more shocked. 

"Don't do anything right?" He looked at Perumal angrily, 

"I don't know how he knew all the truth. You hit him when I was in shock after hearing everything he said. I'm sorry, I never expected this to happen."

"We have to wait. Because, that's what we are doing. When we do something, we have to do it by looking at who is by our side. Otherwise, something like this will happen and put us in front of us," he said. If you see that there is no one, I will go there immediately. 

As he moved from the spot, Vendanar's car was just right for entering the house. 

While they were talking a while back, Vendanar immediately left the place so that Kesavan's voice could not be heard from that side. 

Perumal had started his performance as soon as he saw Vendanar's car. "Daddy wake up. What's wrong with you?" He shouted and cried. 

Perumal heard the sound of crying and wanted to enter the house and was shocked to see Janardhanan lying there speechless. 
"Perumal, what's wrong?" Come near him asking, 

"Uncle, father has left us all," cried Perumal, hugging him. 

Hearing Perumal's words, he did not know what to do. Walking one by one since morning, he couldn't even think straight. Keshavan had called him some time ago and said, "Something is happening in their house without anyone's knowledge." The phone hung up before he could finish. Kesavan's phone did not pick up when he called back. That is why he left there immediately. If you come here and see, they say that Janardhana is not alive. He didn't understand what was happening. 

But one thing was clear, "Something is happening that we don't know about." Until he knew what it was, as Kesavan had said, he thought he didn't want anyone to know that Varman was alive. 

Later, Janardhanan's death was made known to everyone. In the next few hours, all the relatives arrived and the rituals began to take place one by one. 

Some people who came to the dead house said, "Kesavan and his wife are missing. I think they must have done something to him. Otherwise, how did a good man die?" They said. 

Another said, "The horoscope of the second son-in-law of his family is not good. Otherwise, would two people have died in succession in a family that was otherwise good?" Everyone said what came to their mind and said that it was true. Everything fell on Vendar's ears. However, he could not accept their offer kindly. He knew the character of both Kesavan and Valli very well. He firmly believed that they would not have done as they say. 

Mangai did not understand anything. Already, for their selfishness, they had taken the life of one of their sons and lost their father before the ordeal was over. 

All rituals completed. A week has passed since the death of Varman and Janardhanan. Still no one knows the whereabouts of Keshavan and Valli. To inquire about them, Perumal, his mother and his wife were all in the Vendanar palace. At that moment, a guard came to Vendanar's palace and told him that the police had entered the palace, and he also sent them inside with an idea. 

"The police have come," said the general to everyone, he called his sons and Perumal alone and asked, "Did you file a police complaint?" he asked. 

"No, we will not give anything," said Satyavendan and Chandravendan, who went to see Perumal. 

"I don't have any complaints either, uncle," he said. 

"No one filed a police complaint in both our houses, why have the police come here now?" He asked the three thoughtfully. 

Perumal's face turned white with fear. "Where did Keshavan tell the police about Varman?" Thinking that, the whole face started to turn in fear. 

"What, do you want to say something to the police? Have you found Kesavan and Valli?" Mangalammal asked her husband, then the police entered the house.

When they saw the police, the women stood to one side. "Sir, I am Dhenkarai Station Inspector Muthukumar." 

"Tell me brother, what are you here for?" 

"Sir, a week ago a pregnant girl died at the Dhenkarai Government Hospital. It was while we were looking for them that we heard that your relative Janardana's son Adikesavan and his wife had gone missing. We went to his house to inquire about it. They told us they were here. That's why we came here." 

"What do you mean? What happened to my daughter-in-law?" Vatukarasi came to them panicking. 

"Your daughter-in-law and the child in her womb died a week ago. Since no one there knows who they are when they die, let the people in the hospital perform all the rituals for them," he said. 

It took many days for those present to recover from the series of tragedies. In the meantime, Vendana continued his search for Varman without raising suspicion. 

At the same time, Valli and the baby in her womb died the next day when Varman, who was in the neighboring village, came to know that his "Papa" was not alive and became very quiet. As a month passed, Vendanar found Varman and came to his place, but at first refused to see him. Then he asked to say, "I have come here because of his uncle Adikesavan's wish" and after that he agreed to meet him. 

When she saw the eldest heir of their house alive again, her face was so ecstatic, "Varma, are you okay?" to ask, 

Atty did not answer him with his mouth, but only said that his head was fine. 

Even though his calmness was new, he guessed right away that “something is up”. He who thought not to hear it now, remembered what Adikesavan had said and immediately made all arrangements for his departure from here. 

"Grandfather, I will not leave here alone. All these people are going to come with me. You have to take care of everything." 

"Okay, let them come with you to help you. I will prepare everything for them to stay there," he said, and sent Varman and his family, who had been looking after him for so many days, to a village in Madurai. 

The family accompanying Varman - Mani, his wife Shanti, their children Sarathi and Sita. 

He did not say 'who tried to kill him' and 'even his mother knew it'. Yes, Varman also saw his mother see Perumal pushing him off the mountain. Somehow, he didn't feel like telling his grandfather. So he buried everything within himself. 

In the intervening days, Perumal had told Mangai everything about their father's death and Valli's death. 

A few years later, while talking to Vendanar on the phone, Vendanar said that when Valli died normally and that her child was a boy, it was not her "daddy" who died that day. When he came to know that his aunt had done something to prevent anyone from knowing that she was alive, he immediately told his grandfather about it. 

Because from what his aunt had said, her life and hers were very important to those who wanted to kill them. So they searched from then till now, hoping that if they told this to her grandfather, they would find her. As a result of their quest, Mitra also joined Varman's hand. 

Sathyavendan came to know about Mangai's truth two years ago, when he overheard Mangai talking to someone on the phone, Sathyavendan came to know that Valli was murdered and his wife had a role in it. Till today he did not know that it was Perumal who was talking on that side. From that day he could not get along with his wife. He was a little aloof from him. However, he did not tell the true face of his wife to anyone present.

That's all the flashback. No one knows all the facts. The only person who knows is Valli. Now he is also not alive. Grandfather did not know what Varman knew. What the grandfather knew was that Varman and Adikesavan's daughter's life was also in danger. This is because of the Shiva temple where only their family heirs worship, a 
Janardhanan, Vallai's death and Adikesavan's disappearance are all due to that temple. But he doesn't know who is behind it.

    content: `At the same time, Annadurai was shocked to hear the news of Valli's death in the hospital. What would they do without shaking if they heard the news that the person who had been talking to them so well for so long had died in the next ten minutes? Similarly, Annadurai was shocked to hear the news of Valli's death. 

Only now did he understand why Valli had changed the child. He knew very well that the person who had come to see him must have done something to the girl. Because of that, even after hearing the news of Valli's death, Annadurai did not even come close to him. He stayed away from him because he was afraid that if he came close they would find out about the child. 

A week after the birth of the child, the person who brought them home to their hometown, Dhenkar, thought, 'It is not good for them to stay in this town after this.' Since then he has done all the work to get out of here. Similarly, they arranged to sell all their properties, within three months they sold all the land, took the money and went to Madurai. 

Everything went well. Lakshmi also gave birth to a girl as her first child as she wished, so she named her Mithrayajini. After Tanuja and Roshan were born, Annadurai invested all the money he had and started a departmental store. When he started, he started small. After that, growing more and more and keeping the department store big and doing well, Mitra's character did not change at all when Mitra's mother, Sundari, at the age of 15, told Mitra things on her deathbed. But, a few qualities have changed. One of them, from that time till now, she had thought in her mind that the two children she had borne should go to Mitra, and she instilled it in her husband's mind. 

From then on, though he did not show much affection for Mitra, he spoke without hesitation and did not completely withdraw. After all, the first-born girl had an overwhelming love for her, didn't she? That's why he couldn't get rid of her altogether. 

Even when Mitra was of marriageable age, she was the first to be married. But Tanuja, who is infatuated with being a “foreign bridegroom” enters and plays a few games. 
In it, he unilaterally leans towards Lakshmi as his adopted daughter. 

Lo and behold, as a result of this, his beloved daughter Tanuja was scolding him and Lakshmi was not knowing how to pacify her. 

Tanuja shouted angrily, "Why did you remind her right after coming home? It's because of you that my husband can't even talk to me." 

Tanuja was screaming, "No, Tanuma, I have lost my mouth. Do I want to make you angry or make the groom sad?" 

Some time ago, after the wedding, Madesh's mother Chintamani, knowing that the bride and groom had come home, remained in her room to bring both the bride and groom home. 

He never came unless the time had passed for everyone to stand at the door waiting for him to come from home. So Lakshmi herself went inside and took the arati and wrapped the arati around both of them and said, “Mitramma, take your right foot and enter,” and uttered Mitra's name. That's it. The smiles that were on the faces of both the bride and groom all this time disappeared in the next second. Mathesh, who was the first to enter, looked around for his mother, but he could not find the person he was looking for. When he knew that "his mother must be in his room", Mathesh immediately took off the garland from his neck and put it on the sofa and went to his mother's room. 

Here she grabbed her mother's hand with so much anger on her face and dragged her into a room downstairs, screaming at her mother. 

Then Roshan entered the room and said, "Why are you scolding your mother unnecessarily? Do you get angry because of the dirty work you do?” Roshan asked tongue-in-cheek. 

“Dude, speak respectfully. Did I do a bad job? I got hold of him and asked him to marry me. Father and mother agreed. What's wrong with this?"

"What's so bad? Aren't you proud to say that you liked the groom that your sister saw? Despite this bad thing, good things have happened to my sister. Fortunately, my sister will not marry that man. He who marries such a beauty is not suitable for my sister," said Roshan and left the room. 

"He has a very long mouth. Let it be, or else I will kill him,” she muttered, staring at her mother and leaving the room. 

Here, Mathesh went to his mother's room and asked, “Mom... Emma is behaving like this? Do you like everything I like? I like Tanuja. I married her. Why do all this?" 

“Look here Mahesh, if you like Tanuja, you should have said it earlier. You should not have humiliated a girl to such an extent that you came to the wedding hall like this. Honestly, I didn't expect this from you. Please don't talk to me. I don't even want to look at your face. All the questions asked by Durga in the hall are true. Calling gold tin, put it away, let tin be gold now with you. You will understand it soon. Now go out of my room," Chintamani said and sat back. 

Not wanting to torment his mother by staying there again after his mother said so, Mathesh left the room and went to his room without seeing anyone there. 

Tanuja was annoyed to see Madesh going. "Even after marrying the one you love, you cannot be completely happy. She is the cause of everything. Let her come before me, then there is. Anyway, stay at home. It is far from home," she said, growing anger in her heart, and looked at her father-in-law. 

He also saw his daughter-in-law and said, "He is a little upset because his mother is talking to him? So he is a little disturbed. According to religion, there will be nothing. Go and rest for a while, Boma,” he sent her away. 

Both Annadurai and Lakshmi said, “We are also leaving, Samanthi. "Let's call the bridegroom to the other house after a good time," they said, leaving from there. 

Those who set out from there came straight to their homes, where they found the house just as they had left it the night before. The door was not even opened. Only then did Lakshmi realize that she had the house key. "I have the key, where is Mitra?" Thinking that, he opened the house with the key in his hand and went inside, Roshan asked his father the question that was in his mind. 

"The house is locked. So Durga must have gone home. Annadurai sent him away and fetch his sister, Roshan. Roshan was eager to see his sister right away and went to Durga's house immediately. Durga was sitting outside the house as if she was waiting for him. 

As Durga was sitting as if she didn't see Roshan coming, Roshan approached her directly, "Durga sister... where is sister?" He asked. 

That's all, Durga was furious. "Why, have you come to see if she is still alive?" 

"Why are you talking like this? What shall I do for all that they have done?” He asked with slightly confused eyes. 

"You don't have to do anything. But, just seeing you makes me happy. How did you all think to leave her in that situation? Do you think that no matter what you do, you remain silent, no matter what you do?" She asked angrily. 

“Durga, what will he do if you scold him for what he did? Like you, he came very happy to hear about his sister's wedding. Let go, whatever happened happened. Valavan came there saying that nothing is going to happen by talking about it. 

“Uncle, tell me. where is sister I want to see my sister," Roshan cried now.

Valawan remained silent as he did not know what to answer, Durga said, "You will not be able to see her anymore. She has gone where she is supposed to go. She will not come to that house again. You are the one who sent her away by calling her an 'orphan', right? You do not need her after this. You have gone where she wants to go. Don't look for her anymore." 

"Sister, I am scared to hear everything you are saying. Where is my sister? I want to see my sister right now. You are going to scare me by saying something. Stay, I will go immediately and fetch my father," Roshan cried and went to his house. 

Annadurai, who was sitting in the hall, eager to see his daughter, got up and looked at the gate, only his son was there. As his beloved daughter was nowhere to be found, he looked at Roshan and said, "Father, sister has gone somewhere? Sister Durga says that she will not come here anymore. You should come and ask me. I am afraid. Sister is not at home," he cried. 

At what he said, Annadurai stood like a statue, hearing what Roshan said from the kitchen, Lakshmi's vessel fell down in shock and made a noise. 

At the same time, here in Pooncholai village, Varman again throws a bomb to everyone's shock when they hear Satyavendan Valli's death attributed to Mangai. 

"This is shocking. It was not Nandan who pushed me off the mountain. It was someone else. My mother and I know who it is. Even if they know, they will not tell anyone who it is," Varman said while looking at his mother's face. 

Watching everything that was going on there, Mitra thought, "We've got caught up in some murderous crowd."

    content: `"Why are you all shocked by this? It was not Nandan who pushed me off the mountain, but someone else. My petha and my mother also know who it is. Even if they know who it is, they won't tell any of you." So what does that mean? 
Varman said, looking at his mother's face, "She was so fond of him that she did not even tell the man who killed her son when she was ten months pregnant." 

Mangai was struggling to find out all the truths about her one by one, not knowing what to do. 

Vendan noticed it and said, "What Varma said is true. You know that no one has pushed Varma from the mountain. Is it so that you did not tell me about it for so long?" He asked a little angrily. 

"How can she tell me? How could she deceive us all by pretending for so many years! Two years ago, I was so shocked to see her true face. She pretended to know nothing and deceived us all. I was dying to see her. The reason why I was patient for so long was, 'You should not speak without knowing the truth.' That's right. When she knows the person who killed my boy, she shouldn't be in this house for a minute. She should be in this house or I should be in this house," shouted Satyavendan angrily. 

"Shakti, be patient. Varman didn't even tell me this for so long. Does that mean there is more to come? So, be patient. Let everything come out," he said looking at Varman. 

"Grandfather, I don't know many things either. But I think aunty wants to know everything. That's why they all killed aunty," he said, looking at his mother with disgust. 
"Everybody buy a little bit of me. I will show you directly who is the main point of all this," he said and took everyone and went straight to the room where Samshika was. 

Just then, Nandan, leaving the child in the temple, told Pavitra to see that the Yatra does not go anywhere, and hurried home from there. Just as he was coming he noticed that Varman was taking everyone to the room where Samshika was, and he followed them. 

Standing directly in front of the room where Samshika was, he told the people there to be quiet and slowly opened the door that was placed outside, he who already had the key to the room, opened it slowly and asked everyone to look inside. 

Shamshika and her father Perumal were talking earnestly there, when they heard the sound of the door being opened and got up startled. The family in front of them all stood shocked. 

Like them, everyone in the house was shocked to see Perumal there. Even Vendar did not expect this at all. 'Is he the cause of everything?' Couldn't help but shudder. 

"Machan, what are you doing here? Isn't that the room with this girl?" Chandravendan asked, "There is nothing wrong with him being in his girl's room, Sithappa," Varman said with a smile. 

"What, girl?" Mangai did not expect this. Mangai was so angry with her brother when she thought that the person who had told her everything for so many years, not only hid the existence of such a girl, but also ruined her son's life with that girl. 

"Innocent! Is this your girl? Is it unfair that you ruined my life with my boy?" Mangai slapped her brother without looking. 

"Mangai, what to do? I am your brother." 

"It was my brother, who said no? Did I listen to you all these years! But what else is hidden that I don't know? Just because I made a post and said 'okay, okay' to everything you said, my life will be ruined after all these years," cried Mangai. 

"Besides, what's the use of crying? Everything you do is a girl's thing?" Mangaiyammal scolded her daughter-in-law, "Varma, don't drag him out first. We have to know whether everything is true or not. What kind of work have you done with this family?" Mangaiyammal took everyone and came back to the hall.

After a while everyone stood in the hall and Varman started the speech. "Do you remember one day when I snuck up on you and told you to stay with your aunt?" He asked everyone in his house. 

"Yes. The person who said that he would not come the day before, came home the next morning, I remember that well," he wanted to say. 

"It's because I stayed at that house that night with my mother, look, I know the true face of this man. Because I was a little boy, I couldn't tell you about it at that time. When I was about to tell you, this man pushed me away from the mountain," he said, and began to tell what happened that night. 

"Mother suddenly became hungry at night and I was sleepless. When I got up and went out, this man came in from outside and instead of going to the room, he went straight to the store room. I also went to the same store room where he did not make a noise saying, 'Uncle is going to do some work and may show fear at night.' He was not the only one. I don't know if they passed out. I was scared and fell down. I don't know what happened there. 

Apart from that, I can't stay in that house. That's why I immediately called my uncle and came home. Even when I came home, I could not tell anyone because I was afraid of what had happened there. It was only after going to the temple that I felt the need to tell this matter that Adi uncle told me. 'Well, let's go home and tell,' I thought, and there I saw him again. When we went immediately he was not there. While I was thinking, he pushed me down from behind. But when I fell down, I saw the three madams behind me and fell down. 

That God decided that I should not die. Somehow I survived through Adi Mama. Apart from that, uncle went on a wild ride without anyone knowing. Aunty was also there. I knew as soon as I saw them that the aunt was in some fear. But, in the situation at that time, uncle did not investigate anything properly. If we had asked the aunt then, we would have known the whole truth then. But, at that time a Siddhar came there and said something and made Mama go away from there. I still don't know why my uncle left there. But, before uncle left there, suddenly some people came with knives to kill aunty. Then a dragon in that Shiva temple saved us from them. As soon as the raid went away, the aunt felt a sudden pain. Then, it was the neighboring villagers who came there to collect firewood and brought her to the hospital. 

Soon after being brought to the hospital, the aunt gave birth to a baby. I bought it in my hand. As you think, no child will die without an aunt. It's alive," . 

"Then suddenly someone came to the room where my aunt was admitted. My aunt heard her voice and sent me away from there. I don't know what happened there. The next day I got the news that my aunt and the child died. After a few days, my grandfather found me and sent me from that town to Madurai. The only thing that my aunt told me was that it was because of that Shiva temple. I also knew something about it. It has been a long time since the Agni Puja that happens to Shiva once in 50 years has to be done by our dynasty. 

What's amazing about that pooja is that only those with a good heart can perform this pooja. Even if someone wants to get the power of that pooja in a wrong way, the next moment the Shiva Naga protecting that pooja will kill them.

It is the eldest successor of this generation who has to do that puja after the grandfather. You can do that pooja. The problem here is that Nandan and I, who were twins born in the same birth, were born in the same mole. First of all, I was wondering if the puja is happening and they have planned it. But when I think about what to do because I know the truth about them, if I am not alive at that place for them, they may have performed that puja through the heir to be born to Nandan, and they may have attained all its powers. That's why they tried to kill me because they knew the truth so that I should not be alive. But what they didn't expect was that I was still alive before I died."

From what he said, it was clear that what he said as 'aunt' was the mother who gave birth to him. Immediately she wiped her eye without anyone knowing and stood quietly. Varman was watching everything. He remained calm thinking that 'even now if he gets closer, the truth of who she is will be known to the people here.' 

Then, "You idiot! Have you lied to me for so many years?" The one who asked her brother and went to her husband said, "Why, I don't know anything about what Varman is saying. I didn't do anything wrong. The only mistake I made was that he was trying to interfere with me for so long. That's all. According to religion, I didn't do anything wrong," cried Mangai. 

"So what did you do wrong?" Varman looked sharply at his mother. 

Mangai was embarrassed to say that mistake in front of her sons. However, the person who thought that it would not be good not to tell the truth after this, thought, 'It doesn't matter if they think she is ugly, she can tell all the truth about herself,' Mangai thought that she fell in love with the boy who studied with her when she was a child and thought of getting married, only then did she know that he was poor and said, "I don't like him." After that, Mangaiyammal also told her brother to force him to marry her by showing her photographs of the boy. 
No matter how much Perumal talked to the boy about his affection for his younger sister, Perumal killed him at one point so that he would not lose his temper. At first Mangai was scared when she told her sister, then she thought, 'His trouble will be no more' and then crawled away happily, only then did Satyavendan catch her eye. 

Immediately after seeing him, he got hold of him, told his father about it and married him. 

Because of this, Perumal kept him in his favor for so many years. 
The one who spoke all the truth stood without looking up at anyone's face, but Satyavendan, who was close to him, let out a slap. To the point of tearing the ear. A man who had not reached out for a single day in all these years of marriage, for the first time everyone in the house had slapped him with anger towards his wife. 

"Hey big guy! Is this a new habit? The habit of hitting the boy with his hand?" Mangaiyammal scolded her son. 

"Then what? If she had told me before the wedding without concealing her wrongdoing, would I have had so much trouble? By now she is dead with two other people. My son has passed away. It has been so many years. Who is all this? She was the only one who told him about her, and her brother too. "I don't know if Kesavan Machan is alive all these years," said Satyavendan, who shouted angrily at his wife and went straight to Perumal, who was 'elder in age' and 'wife's brother'. 

"Are you a human being? Are you so mad that you would kill your father, your half-brother, your brother's wife, all of them?" Satyavendan, who shouted angrily, looked at his son Varman and said, "Whatever you want to do from now on, I will not stop you from doing anything. I will also tell you about your mother. From now on, everyone in this house should listen to what you say," and angrily went near him. 

All the girls took one look at Mangai and went to their rooms, only the men were there. 

"Varma, have you decided what to do? Looking at all the work they have done, the matter seems a little serious. It is not right for me to leave it like this," Deivaprakash said. 

"You are right, uncle. I have a doubt that they have done all this. I feel that there is someone behind them. It is dangerous for us to let them out until we know that," said Varman, looking at Nandan and telling him some things, he told him to do it immediately.

As Varman said, Nandan got down to the job immediately. "I will not go with him," said Nandan, who was dragged away by four servants. He also now somewhat understood why his wife had stayed with him for so many years. 

When Nandan left there, he said, "Grandpa, a special pooja is being organized in our village temple tomorrow. Tell everyone to be ready for it. We have a little surprise for everyone after going to our temple," and Varman left. 

"Still a surprise?" Deiva Prakash thought, "Machan, every day there are shocks in this house. What shock is your brother waiting to give tomorrow?" He looked at Chandravendan and left. 
Chandravendan took one look at his father and left for the field. Only Vendanar was sitting on the sofa there thinking about something. 

He knew better. From what his father told him, he can get the power to destroy many evil spirits through that pooja. The same power cannot defeat the evil ones if they attain them. His father had heard that at the end of the pooja, a powerful fire called Agni Chuji would be lit. It is well understood that they have worked so hard to achieve that. 

There were still 21 days left for Maha Shivratri, and he was a little afraid of how many more problems would come. 

Here Mitra was crying in Varman's room and Varman was comforting her. 

"Don't look here, you must never cry again. When you were born, I bought you with this hand. When I bought you, I thought, 'I will always hold you in this hand.'" I'm sorry," said Varman, smiling and hugging her. 

"They are the ones who told everyone that I am dead. Then how do you know that I am still alive?" she asked wiping her eyes. 

"I also thought you were dead then. It was only ten years ago that we knew you were alive. 
I came to know one day when my grandfather told me that my aunt had a boy and 'died at birth'. Aunty has lied something to protect you. We have been looking for you from mother without anyone knowing." 

"In all these years, I have not talked to anyone much. I will not talk to anyone except Durga, Valavan Mama and these people. I agreed to marry Madesh not because I like him. I agreed to the marriage only because my father told me. Not right. I had a feeling then, but I didn't even think that my father would cheat on me. Whatever it is, it's a girl, Mitra looked at her husband in confusion. 

He also felt sad for her. "Don't stay here, papu, you shouldn't be upset about anything. It's like we both don't have enough money to grow up even as children. Even for you, both 'father and mother' have been with you for so long. But I know the pain of seeing them standing there, unable to go to them," he said casually with pain in his eyes. 

'For all these years we were happy with them, thinking that they were her father and mother. But, this man...' she felt sad. Mitra seemed to think that God would not give anyone a life without flaws. Not liking the sad look on his face, to call him "Mama," he must say he was stunned with happiness for a second. 

"What? What did you call?" Turning to look at Mitra, Mitra nodded and said, "I called you uncle. Why, don't you like it when I call you uncle?" rolling her eggy eyes and saying,

Varman thought that he would get lost in those eyes. "Do you know how many years I have been waiting for this word 'Mama'?" He smiled beautifully. 

"Honey, uncle, I want to ask you something, will you give it to me?" Mitra asked in eager tongues, not even knowing what he was asking and she shook her head as if to 'give'. 

When Mitra said 'I'll give', he immediately stood up and spoke the language of love with his wife's eyes, "Will you give me just one kiss for this uncle?" He asked. 

Mitra, who thought he was going to ask for something else, who suddenly didn't expect him to ask for a kiss, his cheeks turned red and her face began to sweat. 

"What's wrong honey, uncle said 'I'll give you right away' when he asked? Are you thinking so much now? Maybe you don't like me?" Mitra asked sadly, unable to bear his grief, she gave him a kiss on the cheek before he took off and entered the bathroom from there. 

Varman asked 'What?' He gave her a kiss and ran away before he could even think about it, he was first stunned by her kiss, then he shook his head to hide his pride as he looked at the bathroom she joined. In the same happiness, he called Prakadish and asked him to bring everyone home. 

The next morning dawned beautifully. Everyone in the house got ready to go to the temple, but only Mangai stayed in her room. No one spoke a word to Mangai even when Vendanar told them about everyone going to the temple last night. Even Satyavendan did not like to go to the room where the monk was, but stayed in another room there and used to get ready from there in the morning. 

Even though he did not come, no one forced him to come. "What's up Varma, everyone has come, only you and Bondati will see each other. How long will you be ready?" asked his aunt, 

"I don't know, aunty. I left on time to go to the temple and come home to collect you, but I haven't come home yet. Wait, I'll go and see what's going on," he said and went upstairs to fetch his wife. Just then, his wife Mithrayashini came down from her room. 

Mitra came down the steps like an angel in a golden and silver embroidered silk sari, wearing the yellow rope she had worn on her wedding day and a small aura around her neck, with a bun on her forehead, a few gray hairs in a single braid, and fragrant jasmine in it, and without any make-up. 

Varman froze when he saw his wife walking like an angel. Not only him, but also the people below. Even yesterday she was wearing a disheveled sari and her head was disheveled, so they didn't know her true beauty, but now they were surprised to see that she had taken a normal bath and was wearing a new sari. 

Mitra was coming down and was looking at her husband without blinking. Varman came to his senses as she came down, gazing at the handsome beauty of her husband, who was majestic in his silk shirt, and stood close to him. 

"Brother, that's enough. It's time. Go to the temple and kiss your sister on the side. Let's go to the temple now," said Sarvesh, and the laughter reached Mangai's room. Varman was beautifully embarrassed by their laughter. 

"Okay, it's time. Everyone can go," called Vendanar, "wait a minute, grandpa. More important people have to come," Nandan said while looking at Nandan. 

"Varma, that's why you said she was coming. Why do you think she's coming? She's not that important," Satyavendan said angrily. 

"Father, I will not tell them anything. They are very important. You are going to have a second daughter-in-law," said Varman, "Machan!" A quill's voice was heard at the door. 

As Nandan stood with his back turned, the woman called "Machan" ran to hug Nandan, and everyone in the house was shocked.

    content: `"Hey, who is this girl?" asked Deiva Prakash. 

“Nandanoda Pontati Sita,” said Varman, drawing out every word as he looked at Nandan. 

"What, son? Hey, didn't you just tell us about the first marriage, but at least tell us about the second marriage?" Everyone in the house looked at Nandan with open mouth. 

Seeing everyone's gaze, Nandan said to Sita, who was hugging him, "What are you doing?" 

But, she said, "Machan, why did you run away from there without telling me. If you had said a word to me, I would have come with you, wouldn't I?" cry that 

"Devil, let go first!" He pushed her away from him and looked at his daughter's face. She was looking at both of them casually. Varman told her to understand everything last night. 

"Hey Nanda, what is all this?" Satyavendan asked, "Don't ask me anything. Ask your son who is going with you. He is the one who tied this thing on my head," said Nandan. 

"Dude, one more time, I will tell my father to beat you like a mother who called my mother 'Imsa'. Remember that!" The driver came there as he said. 

He smiled and said to the two who came in, "Father, this driver is my friend. I have been in his house for so many years. This is his younger sister Sita, now your second daughter-in-law." 

"Let's buy it now, it's time," he said, putting his hand on his wife's shoulder and walking forward, everyone followed him with laughter. 

Finally, Nandan went with a glimpse of Sita's happiness as Sita went happily holding her husband's hand. 

While abducting Nandan, Varman threatened him and ended his marriage with Sita. Nandan has been falling in love with her since the day of her marriage. 

After going to the temple and everyone finished the puja and came out happily, a foreign expensive car stopped in front of them. As soon as Varman and the driver saw the car, before they could find out who was inside, a bullet fired from inside the car went towards Varman. In seconds, his wife Mitra took the bullet in her stomach. 

It was all over before they could think about it. At that moment her world stopped spinning as the event unfolded before Varman's eyes, and Mitra fell unconscious on his chest as she gazed at her husband standing in shock. 

When Mitra fainted, he said, "Bapu!" He shouted in a life-melting voice that shook the place. 

Then Shamshika's boyfriend David got out of the car first. Shamshika came down behind him holding his hand. 

Everyone trembled at her and Shamshika approached them smiling at them all. 

"What? If you take me away and seal it up, can't I escape?" She smiled mockingly at Varman, then angrily said, "Well cry, I am happy to see you cry. You are the one who ruined all our plans? I will not leave you alone after this," she pointed the gun in her hand towards him again. 

To show the eye to his grandfather, he took everyone and re-entered the temple and locked the door. 

The man, who lifted his unconscious wife on his lap, looked at the driver and said, "Not a single one should be usurped from here," looking at them and approaching them, while Shamshika and Davids were surrounded by the police. 

"What do you want? It's our plan that makes you come here. You've come and trapped yourself," said Varman, smiling at them, "drag them away," telling the driver to catch Perumal and another person with him, carrying Mitra and going to the hospital. 

Here Nandan came to help the driver, who refused and told him to take everyone in the house safely, called the police and rushed to the place told by their men. 

When they reached there, Varman and Nandan never expected Perumala and another person who had been their strong side for so many days.

Because there, beside Perumal, with a grotesque face staring at himself with a frenzy, was Vatuukkarasi. 

It was Vadiukkarasi who helped Perumal all these days. Due to the absence of a mother and father since childhood, he treated his younger brother like his own child and brought him up with lots of pampering. 

When Janardhanan wanted to marry Vaduukkarasi, he said, "I will marry him only if his younger brother comes with him." Janardhanan fell in love with Vaduukkarasi as soon as he saw him, so he promised to keep Dharma with them and took them to the palace. 
All was well in the new marriage. After a few months, Vadikukarasi let it be that Dharman's attitude was different and asked his tamayan what it was, and that it would not be a big problem as he did not say anything. 

Just then, as was their custom in Vendanar's dynasty, their eldest heir Vendanar and his wife went to perform puja in the Shiva temple, and Dharma followed behind them without their knowledge. 

In the town, all these people told Dharma, "If one attains that power, there is no one in this world who can defeat him," saying that this was it, to stimulate his desire, and with the aim of attaining it, he joined with some miscreants and entered the temple to attain that power. All that said left it unsaid, "If you enter that temple with evil intentions, it is difficult to come out alive." 

So the one who went in, not only saw both of them doing the pooja, but at the end of the pooja, when he came close to the glowing Agni Sathi, the guarding dragon touched him, and the next moment his whole body was poisoned and his body turned blue. 

The two who had come to perform the puja after hearing about the snake that was already here came in with fear. So their eyes were closed so they didn't see anything that happened there. Dharmana opened her eyes only to scream at the snakebite, where the huge snake spewed its venom on Dharmana and re-entered the womb. 

That day 'Dharman's death' was the headline in the whole town. Vaduukkarasi, who kept his brother's life alive, said, "The power that took the life of his brother, he should rule that power." 

Valli was the first to know the truth about him. When Varman came to know about their affair, Valli was caught by Vaduukkarasi before he could escape after hearing what Varman was saying over the phone asking him to kill him. 

"Nobody should be alive if I don't know anything about me," he told Adikesavan to save Varman before approaching Valli, holding Vatudiukkarasi and throwing him down. 

No matter how much Valli tried to tell this to Vendanar, he was unable to tell it till the end. 
Then, Janardhanan came to stop the person who wanted to go quickly, asking that Valli had labor pains and was admitted to the hospital. 

"Queen, what have you done? Do you know? Everything you have done is a sin. Please leave our daughter-in-law. Don't do anything to her," she begged, and without the least bit of mercy, she had injected her husband with the poison that was to be given to Valli. 

He went to the hospital after taking another poison injection. In order to prevent the deceased from having a daughter as the eldest heir of their house, he killed Valli in a fit of rage and attended Varman's funeral 'as if he knew nothing'. As he was showing his normal face everywhere, no one suspected him. Why, even Mangai doesn't know that her mother did it all. 

Varman and Nandan followed Perumal and Vadikukarasi to take them away. After going to the police station, when Varman heard him say everything he had done, he did not know what to think. 

A few hours later, after a long time in the hospital, Mitra woke up with her entire family standing in front of her. But, not seeing her husband alone, Varman entered, looking round and round.

When he entered and saw his wife awake, he rushed without noticing anyone there and hugged his wife with tears in his eyes. 

"Well, I've got nothing," he said, laughing, "do you know that for a minute my life is gone?" He said in a hoarse voice. 

"Where did your life go, uncle?" Sita asked the ignorant child, at which everyone laughed. 

"Ask your husband. He'll tell you where he is," he said, turning her to him, "Why, drag me away?" Nandan looked at him like that. 

"Machan, what is Uncle Verma saying? Where did he die?" asked in a whispering voice, and there was a pattern of it in her whispering voice. "I see, this is a hospital, right? I don't know what I'm going to do with you," said Varman, pulling her out, followed by the others, and stopped them all. 

"A surprise for all of you. I told you, didn't I? That surprise," said an old man, showing the gate and standing there, skin and bones. No one recognized him there. Such was his appearance. 

"Verma, who is this?" Vendar asked first. When Varman got up from his wife, he went near him and took him by the hand and said, "This is my first uncle to everyone. Mitra's true father," and everyone's face was so happy. 

Why, not even Mitra expected this. 
"Varma, my daughter," asked Kesavan, and Varman took him to Mitra's compartment. 

Adikesavan hugged his daughter and called Mitra, "Father," with wide eyes. 

Kesavan was happy to be alive, and everyone was doubly happy when Mitra found out that Kesavan was a girl. 

It has been 20 days since Mitra was brought home from the hospital. Today is the Maha Shivratri said by Vendar. Varman and his wife would finish the night puja and come home only in the morning. All preparations were going on for that. 

No one talks to Mangai. He also started living accepting it saying, 'This is his punishment.' 

At the same time, here in Madurai, "Why did we come home?" Tanuja gives me the idea every day. What his mother said that day was true. Mathesh found out within a week of his marriage that he had rejected gold as tin and made tin his wife. 

However, 'this is his life', he accepts it and lives with pride. It is the same today. In the morning, when she asked her to cook because her mother was not feeling well, she said, "She can't cook everything. If you want, I will order from the hotel." 

Chintamani looked at her son and said, "You need this," and went to his room. 

"Forgive me, Mathesh. I thought it was family honor and I married this girl to you by marrying you and ruining your life," said his father. 

"Excuse me, all this is written in my head. What can I do?" After saying that, Mathesh went to his office. 

At the same time, Annadurai Lakshmi also broke down hearing that Roshan said that his sister had gone somewhere. Even though he betrayed Mitra with affection for his own daughter, he had more affection for her as 'the first child'. 

But when Tanuja threatened to stay, that's why both of them agreed to the marriage. But now when Mithrayazini said that she will not come here anymore, both of them broke down. 

After going straight to Durga and getting Mitra's address, the three of them came towards Pooncholai village in a week. Unexpectedly, the car they came in met with an accident and Annadurai and Lakshmi died on the spot. 

Roshan, who was hit only on the head, was taken to the hospital and Roshan called Mitra from the phone, which was picked up by Varman. Those who told all that had happened, Varman told the people in his house not to tell Mitra about this now, "to buy Padi," and he himself came to Madurai and performed all the rituals for Annadurai and Lakshmi.

Valavan asks about Mitra's arrival and tells her what happened and says she still doesn't know. After asking Roshan to take care of Valavan, he came to Pooncholai. 

Later, only after Mitra recovered well, she was told about the death of both Annadurai and Lakshmi. 

Mitra was saddened that she could not even go to the funeral of those who raised her as 'mother and father' for so many years. Amidst this, Valavan and Durga come and see Mitra after Roshan recovers and takes him along. 

Behold, both the husband and wife have left for the Shiva temple. Both husband and wife entered the dilapidated Shiva temple alone in the dark forest, holding hands, where snakes were everywhere. Lo and behold, with all the holy conch, holy water, and the holy flower suitable for Shiva, they performed the puja from the house to Shiva's lingam. 

Puja was performed throughout the night and as a result, Agni Chuli appeared on the lingam and blessed both the husband and wife. After all the pooja was completed, both the husband and wife journeyed home with contentment. 

Sita was standing at the door of the house with aarti for them. 

"Andi, the aarti is taken away only after they come. Why are you standing on the door step with the aarti in your hand since morning?" Nandan who came near her asked, 

"Oh machan, you don't know anything. If you take aarti, put a lot of money. No matter where in our town, wherever aarti is performed, I will stand in the front. Only now, if I didn't come in front, what will I do if someone else takes aarti and buys money?" Nandan looked at her and patted her on the head, saying with the village's pride. 

While he was lamenting that "Vechu has put this madness on my head and wasted my life," his beloved daughter Yatra came there with aarti in her hand, calling him "Daddy". 

Nandan thought, "Lord! My daughter has become like her now that she has come together." 

"Pilgrim boy, what gold is this?" 

"Father, only Seethamma and Varma are taking aarti for father. Shouldn't I take it? I will also take it for my father," he said looking at Sita's face and saying, 

"Hey, here is Barudi Silvandu! I will perform aarti for my uncle and sister first. If you want it, you can go and get it. Have you come..." to smile. 

Seeing both of them, everyone in the house hit their heads. 

Without keeping them waiting for a long time, both the husband and wife got out of the car with so much happiness on their faces, "Sir.., uncle and sister are here!" Sita screamed, 

In which all came to the gate. 
"Uncle, I will perform aarti for you first. Then you have to pay me a lot of money, okay?" Saying that, Aarti went around and stood before Varman with outstretched hand, 

"Dad, you don't have to give them first, I want to give it to you," Pushing Sita away, she wrapped her pinched hands around her 'Varma Dad', 'Mitra Amma', took the plate from her hand and handed it to her younger sister Pavitra, who carried her in his arms, Varman kissed her on the cheek, and to see his friend Sarathi, ten 500 rupee notes each. Varman divided it equally and gave it to both. Carrying the Yatra, he entered the house. 

"Owner of such a great empire, can you go and fight for money like this?" To tease both the drivers, 

"Boda dubku!" That Yatra would knock him down on one side and his younger sister Sita on the other side, and the place was lively. 

I wish them all the same happiness and farewell, thank you and hello🙏🙏🙏.
