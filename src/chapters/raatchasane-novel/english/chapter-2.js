  content: `"Hey! Will Mithu's father come to this meeting, or will he make an excuse like always?"

"He won't come. Mom is lying. He doesn't have a father at all. How can he come?"

Mithu's classmates teased him mercilessly. The poor boy sat back, tears streaming down his face. That's when Puvana, a girl in his class, sat beside him and tried to console him.

"Don't worry, Mithu. I believe your father will definitely come this time. Your mother said that if you get first rank, your father will come. So study well and get first rank."

"But I can't study," Mithu said, his lips trembling.

"Do you want to see your father?"

"Yes."

"Then study. I'll help you."

"Really?" The boy's eyes lit up with hope as he blinked.

"Really," Puvana said with a smile.

From that moment on, Mithu became obsessed with studying. He was determined to see his father. The boy who had always failed in some subject now studied day and night without sleep. One night, when Adhira woke up for water, she found her son still studying. She was shocked and worried at the same time. Did her son really care so much about his father?

Mithu studied desperately, driven by the desire to meet his father. Even when Adhira scolded and hit him, he had never studied like this. But now he stayed awake all night, studying without rest. 

Pooja watched her brother's dedication with amazement. The girl who was deaf and mute seemed to understand what was happening.

Exams came and went.

Mithu studied like a madman throughout the exams. But in the last math exam, one question stumped him. Desperate, he glanced at Puvana who sat behind him. She understood his silent plea and pointed to the answer. Mithu wrote it down and completed his exam.

Finally, the results came.

As the teacher distributed answer sheets, she announced the rankings. Usually, Puvana always got first rank. But this time, Puvana was pushed to second place. Everyone was curious—who got first rank?

"Mithreswaran got first rank!" the teacher announced.

Mithu. The joy in the boy's eyes was indescribable. He would see his father now. His eyes filled with happy tears as he clutched his rank card, jumping with excitement. Behind him, little Puvana watched with a smile, her hand resting on her cheek.`
