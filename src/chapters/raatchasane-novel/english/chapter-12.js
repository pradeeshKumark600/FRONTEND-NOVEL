  content: `The second school dance arrived, and this time, Mithu was going with Puvana. He was nervous in a way he had never been before. This wasn't just about friendship anymore; it was about romance, about the beginning of something new and beautiful.

Mithu dressed carefully, choosing clothes that he thought looked nice. When he arrived at Puvana's house to pick her up, his breath caught. She looked absolutely stunning in a simple but elegant dress, her hair arranged beautifully, and a smile on her face that was meant only for him.

They walked to the school together, hands intertwined, not needing to communicate. The silence between them was comfortable, filled with the understanding that only two people who truly knew each other could share.

At the dance, they started by just talking and laughing with their friends. But as the evening progressed and the music became slower, they found themselves on the dance floor together. Mithu held Puvana close, and she rested her head on his shoulder. It was a perfect moment, one that Mithu knew he would remember for the rest of his life.

When a romantic song came on, Mithu found himself whispering to Puvana, "I love you."

She pulled back to look at him, and though she couldn't speak the words, her eyes told him everything he needed to know. She pulled out her phone and texted him: "I love you too, you idiot. Finally."

The night ended with them sitting on a bench outside the school, talking about their future. Puvana wrote about her dreams of becoming a writer, maybe even an author someday. Mithu shared his dreams of becoming a counselor or social worker, someone who could help children like him and Puvana who had faced adversity.

"We can do it together," Puvana wrote. "Whatever we do, we do it together."

Mithu kissed her forehead and promised that no matter what life threw at them, he would always be by her side.

When Mithu came home that night, his parents could immediately tell that something wonderful had happened. He was glowing with happiness.

"Met someone special?" his mother asked with a knowing smile.

Mithu blushed but nodded. He told them about Puvana, about how she was deaf and mute, about how intelligent and kind she was, and about how he was in love with her.

Ravi and Adhira listened with pride. They had raised a son who didn't judge people by their disabilities or limitations, but who saw them for who they truly were—complete, whole human beings deserving of love and respect.

"She sounds wonderful," Adhira said, hugging her son. "I'd like to meet her properly."

And so began a new chapter in Mithu's life, one where he wasn't just a boy yearning for his father's presence, but a young man building his own future with the woman he loved.`
