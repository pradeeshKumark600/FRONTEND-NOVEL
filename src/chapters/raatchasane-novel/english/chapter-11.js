  content: `The school year progressed, and Mithu found himself increasingly drawn to Puvana. It wasn't just friendship anymore; it was becoming something deeper. The way she understood him without words, the way she supported him unconditionally, the way her face lit up when she saw him—it all pointed to feelings that transcended friendship.

However, Mithu was hesitant to express these feelings. He feared that confessing might jeopardize their friendship. Moreover, he wasn't sure if Puvana felt the same way. Her gestures and written words were always friendly, never romantic.

One day, a boy named Arjun started paying attention to Puvana. He was a new student, charming and confident. He learned sign language specifically to communicate with her, and he asked her to the school dance.

Mithu felt a sharp pang of jealousy when he saw them talking together. He realized then that he couldn't keep his feelings hidden any longer. He had to tell Puvana how he felt, even if it meant risking their friendship.

He waited for the right moment. That moment came after the school dance. Puvana had attended with Arjun, and seeing them together had made Mithu miserable. He decided he couldn't take it anymore.

After school the next day, he asked Puvana to meet him at their favorite spot by the lake. There, with trembling hands, he wrote out his feelings on a piece of paper and handed it to her.

"Puvana, I've been your friend for so long, and I care about you more than anyone in this world. I know you went to the dance with Arjun, and I know I have no right to say this, but I have to. I'm in love with you. Not as a friend, but as something more. I understand if you don't feel the same way, and I promise I won't let this affect our friendship. But I couldn't keep it hidden anymore."

Puvana read the note, her eyes widening with surprise. She looked at Mithu for a long moment, then began to write furiously on her notepad.

"You idiot," she wrote. "I thought you'd never figure it out. I've been in love with you since we were in elementary school. Why do you think I gave up first rank? Why do you think I help you with everything? Why do you think I learn about your life like I'm writing a biography?"

Mithu's heart stopped as he read her words. She loved him too. All this time, they had been dancing around their feelings, too scared to make the first move.

"So what now?" he wrote.

"Now we go to the school dance together, next week, when they hold the second dance. And you're going to dance with me, not with some girl who doesn't understand you like I do."

Mithu smiled, the biggest smile he had smiled in years. He took Puvana's hand, and they sat by the lake as the sun set, not needing words to communicate what they both felt.

The confession had broken the barrier between friendship and love, and their bond became stronger than ever.`
