  content: `The next school year began, and with it came new challenges and opportunities. Mithu was now in a higher grade, and the academics became more demanding. But with both his mother and father supporting him, he tackled the challenges with confidence.

Puvana continued to be his closest friend. They studied together, shared secrets, and supported each other through the difficulties of growing up. Mithu never explicitly acknowledged his deep feelings for her, but they were becoming increasingly apparent to everyone around them.

One day, Ravi brought up the subject that had been hanging over the family for months.

"Adhira, I know things have been complicated between us," he said, sitting down with her in the living room. "But I want to make things official. I want to marry you again, or if you prefer, we can have a simple commitment ceremony. I want to be a proper husband and father to this family."

Adhira was surprised. She had been waiting for him to prove himself, and he had done that consistently. Still, the past was hard to forget.

"What about your job? Your business? I remember you were always too focused on those things to spend time with us," she said, her voice tinged with old hurt.

"I've made changes," Ravi replied. "I've hired people to manage most of my work. My priority now is this family. And that's not just words, Adhira. I've already started cutting back my hours. Ask Mithu—I've been picking him up from school every day for the past three months."

Adhira did ask Mithu, and the boy confirmed everything his father said. She also realized that Ravi had indeed changed. He was more present, more engaged, more in love with the family than he had ever been.

"I need to think about it," she finally said. But deep down, she had already decided. She was going to give this marriage another chance.

Mithu could sense that something was changing in his household. There was a lightness in the air, a sense of possibility. One evening, when he came home from school, both his parents were waiting for him in the living room.

"Mithu," his mother said, her eyes glistening with tears, "your father and I have decided to get married again. We want to be a complete family."

Mithu's face lit up with joy. This was everything he had ever wanted. He hugged both his parents, and for the first time in his life, he felt truly complete.

Even Pooja, in her own way, seemed to understand the significance of the moment. She clapped her hands in delight, happy that her brother was happy.`
