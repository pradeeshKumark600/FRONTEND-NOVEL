  content: `Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. Ravi became a regular fixture in their lives. He helped Mithu with homework, took him to movies, and even attended his school events. The bond between father and son grew stronger with each passing day.

But tension still existed between Ravi and Adhira. Their past was too complicated, their wounds too deep. They were trying to make things work for the sake of the children, but it wasn't easy.

Puvana noticed how much Mithu had changed. He was happier, more talkative, and more confident in class. She was genuinely happy for her friend, even though she had secretly harbored a crush on him for a long time. Seeing him happy was enough for her.

One day, Mithu asked Puvana, "Why do you always help me? Even when you could have gotten first rank?"

Puvana blushed slightly. "Because your happiness is more important to me than a rank."

Mithu didn't fully understand what she meant at that age, but he sensed it was something significant. He gave her a grateful smile.

As months passed, Ravi started suggesting that maybe they should try living together again, as a proper family. Adhira was hesitant. She had built a life for herself and her children, and she didn't know if she could trust Ravi completely.

"I know I've hurt you," Ravi said one evening. "But I've changed. I've had a lot of time to think about what I did, and I regret it every day. Please, give me another chance. Not just for me, but for Mithu. He needs both his parents."

Adhira wanted to believe him. She really did. But her heart was protected by walls that wouldn't come down easily.

"I need time," she finally said. "I need to see that you're really sincere. Actions speak louder than words, Ravi."

Ravi nodded. He understood. He would have to prove himself through his actions, day after day.

In the meantime, Mithu's success in school continued. He wasn't just about academics anymore—he was developing as a person. He became more empathetic, more understanding of others' pain. And he credited much of this growth to Puvana's friendship and his father's presence.

The school year was coming to an end, and there was talk of a class picnic. Mithu was excited, and so was everyone else. It would be a day of fun and adventure for the whole class.

Puvana was especially looking forward to it, as she would get to spend the entire day with Mithu outside of school.`
