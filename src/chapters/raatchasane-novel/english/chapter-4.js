  content: `The man stepped forward, and Mithu's breath caught. Could this really be his father?

"Hello son," the man said softly, extending his hand. "I'm sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic."

Mithu stared at him, unable to move. His father. After ten years, he was finally seeing his father. The boy's eyes filled with tears as he threw himself into the man's arms.

"Papa!" he cried out, the word muffled against his father's chest.

Adhira watched from a distance, her own eyes welling up. She had wanted this moment for so long, but now that it was here, she felt uncertain. What did his sudden appearance mean?

The man, whose name was Ravi, looked over Mithu's shoulder at Adhira. There was regret in his eyes, but also determination. He had come back to try to make things right, or at least to be a father to his son.

That evening, Ravi took Mithu and Pooja out for ice cream. He was kind to both children, though he was especially attentive to Mithu, asking him about school, his friends, his favorite subjects.

When they returned home, Ravi sat down with Adhira. They talked late into the night—about the past, about their mistakes, about the children. It was a difficult conversation, filled with pain and regret. But through it all, one thing was clear: both of them still loved their son, and both wanted to be a part of his life.

Ravi began visiting regularly after that day. Every week, he would take Mithu out, teach him things, help him with his studies. The boy's personality began to change. He became happier, more confident. His grades continued to improve because now he wasn't just studying for a phantom father—he was studying with his father's encouragement.

Adhira watched this transformation with mixed emotions. On one hand, she was grateful that Mithu finally had a father figure. On the other hand, she worried about what would happen when Ravi decided to leave again. Her past experience had taught her that men could be unreliable.

But Ravi seemed determined to be different this time. He even began helping Adhira with household expenses, trying to lighten her burden. Slowly, the wounded family began to heal.

One day, Mithu asked his father, "Papa, will you stay with us now?"

Ravi looked at his son, then at Adhira. He wanted to say yes, but life was complicated. There were promises, responsibilities, and scars that couldn't be easily mended.

"I'm trying, son," he said finally. "I'm trying my best."

And for now, that had to be enough.`
