  content: `The school's annual function day arrived. Mithu had been counting down the days with trembling excitement. Today was the day his father would finally come. He had prepared a special surprise for the occasion—a solo performance that he had been practicing in secret with the help of his teacher.

Adhira dressed her children carefully. Mithu wore a crisp white shirt and blue shorts, his hair neatly combed. Pooja wore a beautiful frock, and even though she couldn't hear the music, she would sit on stage with Mithu as moral support.

The auditorium filled with parents and students. Adhira sat in the front row, her eyes constantly scanning the entrance. Her heart raced every time the door opened, but each time, it was just another parent.

The function began. One by one, children performed songs, dances, and plays. When it was finally Mithu's turn, he walked onto the stage with his heart pounding. He looked into the audience, searching for his father's face.

He didn't see him.

But Mithu continued anyway. He sang a song he had practiced for weeks, a beautiful melody about longing and hope. His voice was clear and true, filling the auditorium with emotion. By the time he finished, there wasn't a dry eye in the audience.

Puvana sat in the audience watching him with admiration. When the song ended and Mithu took his bow, she was the first to stand up and clap loudly, encouraging others to do the same. A standing ovation followed.

Mithu came backstage, disappointed that his father wasn't there despite his best performance. He had given everything on that stage, hoping to impress his father, but once again, he was disappointed.

Adhira hugged her son as he tried to hide his tears. She didn't say anything. Words couldn't heal this kind of pain.

But then, as they were leaving the auditorium, a man appeared at the entrance. He was tall, well-dressed, and had Mithu's exact same features. The boy froze when he saw him.

"Mithu?" the man called out, his voice uncertain.

The boy's world stopped. Was this his father?`
