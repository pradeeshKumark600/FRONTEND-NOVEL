  content: `Married life suited Ravi and Adhira. The house was now filled with laughter and warmth. Ravi transformed into the father and husband he should have been from the beginning. He helped with household chores, attended school events, and most importantly, he was present—emotionally and physically.

Mithu thrived in this new environment. His grades improved even further, and he developed a newfound confidence. He was no longer the boy seeking his father's approval; he was now a boy secure in his family's love.

At school, Mithu and Puvana remained inseparable. They were now in their early teenage years, and while Mithu's feelings for her were becoming increasingly romantic, he hadn't yet found the courage to express them. Puvana, on her part, seemed content with their friendship, though she too harbored deeper feelings that she kept hidden.

One day, the school organized an inter-school debate competition. Mithu decided to participate, hoping to impress both his parents and Puvana. He chose to speak about the importance of family and support systems in a child's development. It was a topic close to his heart.

Puvana helped him prepare, writing suggestions and critiques on her notepad. She was his first audience, listening intently as he practiced his speech over and over again, refining his arguments and delivery.

The day of the competition came. The auditorium was filled with students and teachers from various schools. Mithu stood on stage, his heart pounding, but when he looked towards the audience and saw his parents sitting in the front row and Puvana cheering him on, his confidence surged.

He delivered his speech with passion and conviction. He spoke about his own journey, about the pain of parental absence and the joy of reunion. While he didn't mention names, anyone close to him would have recognized the personal nature of his narrative.

The judges were impressed. Mithu won first prize in the debate competition.

After the event, his parents hugged him with pride, and Puvana jumped up and down excitedly, signing a congratulatory message in the air that only Mithu could understand.

That evening, the family went to a restaurant to celebrate. Ravi gave a toast to his son, expressing his pride and love. Adhira held her son's hand, tears of happiness streaming down her face.

Mithu looked at his family—whole, complete, and happy—and he felt a deep sense of gratitude for the journey that had brought them all to this point.`
