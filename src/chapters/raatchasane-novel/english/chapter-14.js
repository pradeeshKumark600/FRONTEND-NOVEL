Mithu stood in front of the gathered crowd, delivering a speech at his college graduation. But this wasn't just any graduation—he was receiving an award for his thesis on "The Psychological Impact of Parental Absence on Children" and his work at a local NGO that counseled children from broken homes.

Puvana sat in the front row, beaming with pride. She too had graduated with honors, her thesis being a collection of stories about her life experiences and how overcoming disability had shaped her perspective on life. Several publishers had shown interest in her work, and she was on her way to becoming the author she had always dreamed of being.

Adhira and Ravi sat next to Puvana, their faces radiating the kind of pride that only parents could feel. Ravi still thought about the lost years, about the time he had wasted being absent from his family. But he had made amends, and he had spent the last fifteen years being the father and husband his family deserved.

After the ceremony, they all gathered outside for photographs. Mithu hugged his parents, kissed Puvana, and felt a sense of completion that he had never felt before.

"I'm so proud of you, son," Ravi said, his voice thick with emotion. "Everything you've achieved, you did it on your own. I'm just glad I got to be a part of your journey."

Adhira simply held her son's face in her hands and cried tears of joy. Her baby boy had grown into a compassionate, intelligent, and kind-hearted man.

That evening, there was a celebration dinner with close family and friends. Mithu made a toast, dedicating his achievements to his parents for never giving up on him, to Puvana for being his strength and his support, and to Pooja, who had taught him that disability doesn't define a person's worth.

Pooja, now a skilled sign language interpreter and advocate for the deaf community, smiled and clapped her hands in approval.

As the dinner progressed, Mithu found himself reflecting on the journey. The demon that had tormented him—the pain of his father's absence—had indeed transformed him into the man he was today. It had taught him empathy, resilience, and the importance of human connection.

Later that night, as Mithu walked Puvana home, she stopped and turned to him. She took out a piece of paper and wrote: "Mithu, I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?"

Mithu laughed at the irony—he had been planning to propose to her, but she had beaten him to it. Without hesitation, he kissed her and wrote back on the same paper: "Yes. A thousand times yes."

And so, the boy who had once yearned for his father's love found himself complete in the love of a woman who understood him like no one else could. The demon had been vanquished, not through revenge or hatred, but through love, compassion, and the unwavering belief that even the deepest wounds could heal.

The novel ends not with a question of why the demon torments us, but with the answer: it teaches us to love deeper, to hold closer to those who matter, and to transform our pain into purpose.

Mithu and Puvana's story was proof that even in the darkest of circumstances, there is always light. And that light, when nurtured with love and dedication, can illuminate not just one life, but many.
