  content: `She adjusted her cotton saree neatly and stood before the tall mirror. Even after ten years, she hadn't changed much. Just a touch of makeup made her look a bit different, but otherwise, she was still at the peak of her beauty.

The gold mangalsutra around her neck, the bangles on her wrists—everything remained the same. Though not accustomed to wearing makeup regularly, she carefully applied vermillion on her forehead and hair partition. Just then, her ten-year-old son ran to her and hugged her tightly.

Right behind him came Pooja, a girl of thirteen, with early teenage charm. 

"Mom! Mom! Sister is chasing me!"

Just a typical sibling argument.

Adhira looked at her daughter questioningly.

"Mom! It's time for school, but he won't get dressed!" Pooja said through gestures and signs.

Pooja had been deaf and mute since birth. But Adhira had worked tirelessly through many treatments to restore some hearing to her daughter. Still, sometimes Pooja's hearing wasn't perfect, and she couldn't speak at all.

Adhira knelt down in front of her son.

"Hey, Mithu! Why are you like this? It's time for school. Why haven't you left yet?" Her tone wasn't scolding, but had a mild threat to it.

"I won't go to school," the young boy said stubbornly, his anger reminiscent of his father's temperament.

Adhira had always been struggling with these situations. Her husband had abandoned them ten years ago, and she raised her children alone with great difficulty. She worked hard, did everything she could to give her children a normal life, but there was a void that no mother's love could fill—the absence of a father.

The children, especially Mithu, felt this absence deeply. Mithu had never seen his father. He only knew that his father was supposed to visit sometimes, but he never showed up. This made the boy rebellious and difficult to handle.

But Adhira never lost hope. She believed that one day things would change. She did everything to make her children understand that their father loved them, even if he wasn't present. She created stories to tell them, showing their father in a positive light, though deep inside, her heart broke at the thought of his abandonment.

Mithu had inherited his father's stubborn nature, and Adhira found herself in the same position as her own mother must have been—trying to control a temperamental man. But she was determined. No matter what, she would raise her children to be good human beings.

The morning sun cast long shadows through the window as Adhira continued her struggle to get Mithu ready for school.`
