  content: `The school year came to an end, and Mithu and Puvana found themselves facing the reality of college entrance exams. The pressure was immense, not just from academics but from the uncertainty of what the future held.

Mithu worked hard to prepare for his exams. His parents supported him in every way they could. Ravi helped with subjects he was strong in, and Adhira made sure he had a healthy diet and adequate rest.

Puvana, despite her disabilities, was equally dedicated. She attended special coaching classes and worked with a sign-language interpreter who helped her understand the course material. Her determination was inspiring.

During the exam period, Mithu and Puvana found comfort in each other's presence. They studied together, taking breaks to go for walks or sit by the lake. Puvana's presence calmed Mithu's nerves, and his encouragement boosted her confidence.

The exams finally ended, and they had to wait for the results. It was a tense time, filled with anxiety and anticipation. But they had each other, and that was enough.

When the results came, Mithu had done well—not as spectacularly as before, but well enough to get into a good college. Puvana had also done well, and they both got into the same college.

Fate, it seemed, was keeping them together.

On the day the results were announced, they went to their favorite spot by the lake to celebrate. Puvana wrote on her pad: "We made it. We're going to college together."

"And we're going to change the world together," Mithu added.

As they sat there, watching the sunset, Mithu realized that his journey from being a broken boy yearning for his father to a confident young man in love with an extraordinary woman had been one of the most transformative experiences of his life.

His demons—the hurt, the anger, the sense of abandonment—had been exorcised through love, support, and the passage of time. His father had returned, his family was whole, and he had found his soulmate.

The novel's title, "Oh Demon! Why Do You Torment Me!", now had a different meaning. The demon wasn't an external force; it was the pain within himself that he had to overcome. And he had done it, with the help of those who loved him.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, Mithu held Puvana close and whispered a promise to themselves, to their love, and to the future: "No matter what comes, we face it together."

And Puvana, unable to speak but always understood by the one who mattered most, squeezed his hand in affirmation.`
