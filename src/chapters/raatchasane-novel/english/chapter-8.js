  content: `The wedding preparations began in earnest. It was going to be a small ceremony, just close family and friends. Adhira wanted to keep it intimate, a fresh start for the whole family.

Ravi involved Mithu in the preparations, making the boy feel like an important part of the wedding. Mithu helped choose decorations, designed invitations, and even contributed ideas for the reception menu.

Puvana learned about the upcoming wedding from Mithu. She was genuinely happy for her friend, even though she felt a pang of something else that she couldn't quite name. Her mother noticed the change in her daughter's demeanor and asked what was wrong.

"Nothing, Mom," Puvana said, writing in her notebook. "I'm just happy for Mithu."

But there was a hint of wistfulness in her words.

The day of the wedding arrived. It was a beautiful afternoon ceremony held in a small hall decorated with flowers and lights. Mithu stood next to his father as the best man, and Pooja scattered flowers as the flower girl.

Adhira looked radiant in her wedding saree, her face glowing with hope and new beginnings. When she and Ravi exchanged vows, the sincerity in their voices was unmistakable. They were making a promise not just to each other, but to their children—a promise of a complete family, of stability, of love.

After the ceremony, there was a reception with music and dancing. Mithu danced with his mother, spinning her around while she laughed. It was a moment of pure joy, untainted by the complications of the past.

Later, Mithu saw Puvana sitting alone at a table. He went and sat next to her.

"Thank you for coming," he said simply.

Puvana wrote on her notepad: "Always here for you, silly."

Mithu smiled. He knew that Puvana would always be his friend, no matter what. Whether it was just friendship or something more, the bond between them was unbreakable.

As the evening progressed, Ravi and Adhira danced together, and Mithu watched them with contentment. His mother looked happy—truly happy—for the first time in years. His father looked like a man who had finally found redemption.

And Mithu felt like his life had finally fallen into place.

The wedding night, as the family returned home together, felt different. It felt like the beginning of something new, something precious. The house that had been filled with tension and absence was now filled with love and presence.

Mithu fell asleep that night with a smile on his face, dreaming of a future where his family was whole and complete.`
