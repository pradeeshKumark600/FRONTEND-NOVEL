  content: `The day of the class picnic arrived with bright sunshine and clear skies. The entire class boarded a bus early in the morning, heading towards a nearby nature reserve. The children were excited, chattering about the games and activities planned for the day.

Mithu sat next to Puvana on the bus. She tried to communicate with him through gestures and written notes, which had become their way of deeper conversation. Mithu found that writing to Puvana had made him more thoughtful and intentional with his words.

When they reached the picnic spot, the teachers organized various games and activities. There was a treasure hunt, a relay race, and a swimming competition. Mithu participated in all of them, sometimes winning, sometimes not. But he was enjoying himself immensely, which was what mattered most.

During lunch, Mithu sat with Puvana and some other classmates. He shared his food with her, and she did the same. There was a comfortable friendship between them that transcended the usual school friendships of that age.

In the afternoon, while others were playing, Mithu wandered away from the group. He found a quiet spot by the lake and sat alone, watching the water. He was thinking about his father, wondering if this happiness would last.

Puvana found him there. She sat next to him without saying anything—or rather, without writing anything. Sometimes words, even written ones, weren't necessary. They sat in silence for a while, two children dealing with their own complexities in their own ways.

"Do you ever feel like things are too good to be true?" Mithu finally asked, breaking the silence.

Puvana picked up a stick and wrote in the sand: "Always. But maybe that's when we should hold on tighter."

Mithu looked at her, surprised by the wisdom in those words. For a thirteen-year-old girl who had suffered so much in her life, Puvana had a maturity that most adults didn't possess.

That evening, as they were heading back home on the bus, Mithu felt a strange sense of contentment. Life was still complicated, his parents' situation was still uncertain, but for now, he had good friends, a present father, and moments like these that reminded him that happiness was possible.

When the bus dropped him off at his house, his father was waiting at the gate. Ravi had coordinated with the school to surprise Mithu after the picnic.

"How was your day, son?" Ravi asked, ruffling his hair.

"It was great, Papa," Mithu said with a genuine smile. "Everything was great."

Ravi hugged his son, and for the first time in a long time, he felt like things might actually work out between him and his family.`
