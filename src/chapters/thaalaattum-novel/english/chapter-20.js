  content: `"What to do now? Varman even saw me, didn't he?" Perumal panicked a bit, deciding that if he remained alive, nothing they thought would happen. Having made that decision, he slept that night.

Accordingly, the next morning, everyone at Janarthanan's house were seated at the dining table.

Just then, Varman woke up from sleep and came out of the room, went straight to his uncle Athikesavan. "Uncle, I want to go home, please take me there and drop me," he said, looking at his elder uncle with fear. Both his uncles who were watching him noticed this.

"Why is he afraid looking at brother? Brother's behavior last night wasn't right either. I thought I'd talk to Varman today, but he's asking to be dropped home," he thought. "Okay, I can talk to him in the car on the way," he thought and nodded yes to what Varman said.

"Kesava, I also have some work to talk to Mangai about. I'll come with you," Perumal said, looking at Varman.

Hearing what Perumal said, Athikesavan knew very well that something was not right with his brother. Yet, because he let it pass casually saying "Let's see," it would later become a very big problem—he himself couldn't have imagined.

No matter how much Valli and Vadivukarasi said, Varman, not wanting to stay there, insisted on going to his house immediately. Without even letting Athikesavan eat properly, he took him along.

Perumal also went behind them.

Even at eight years old, Varman, having shrewd intelligence like a cheetah, knowing why his uncle was following them, didn't sit near him in the car but sat beside his uncle Athikesavan.

In a short while, all three reached the Venthanar palace. At that morning time, everyone was sitting at the dining table eating. Mangai was the first to see them.

"Brother, come brother. Why did you suddenly come without saying or calling?" Mangai approached both her brothers with a smile. Their beloved son, without looking at anyone, ran quickly to his room.

Venthanar looked at Varman's action without understanding.

"What brother, the one who refused to come even when I called yesterday, has gotten up and come this morning," Mangai said laughing.

"Don't know, dear. As soon as he woke up from sleep, he insisted on going home, only one insistence. He didn't even let me eat breakfast," Athikesavan said.

"Okay, come inside both brothers. Let's eat," Mangai invited, and they too sat down to eat.

Everyone was eating normally, but Perumal alone kept looking at the upstairs.

Athikesavan was just observing each of his brother's actions.

To divert Athikesavan's attention, Mangai was the one who spoke. "Aunt, uncle, I told you yesterday, right? Today I said I was going to Kunrakudi Murugan temple. Vasanthi and I will go and come back."

"Okay, dear, go and come. You shouldn't go alone. Sathyan, Chandra, you too take the children and go together as a family," said Venthanar.

They too said okay and prepared to go to the temple.

Kesavan and Perumal, who had been talking for a while, said Kesavan should leave as it was getting time. Perumal, who had been expecting Varman to come down, when he didn't seem to be coming down, thought, "They're all going to the temple. I can deal with him there," and left with his brother.

At 10 o'clock, everyone except Bapaa and Paati left for the temple.

Here, Kesavan was driving the car thoughtfully. "Kesava, stop the car for a bit. I have some work at our farm," said Perumal.

As Kesavan was also in some thought, he stopped the car. Perumal got down from it and said he would come home himself in the afternoon, and left from there.

Kesavan too said okay and left with the car. Perumal, who stood looking at the farm until the car left, as soon as the car disappeared, took out his phone, told another car to come, and in the next two minutes, left for Kunrakudi.

Here, Varman's family all reached Kunrakudi Murugan temple in one hour. Perumal had come before them and was waiting in a secluded spot.

Those who went inside the temple finished all their prayers in a short time and were sitting in the temple sanctum talking, the elders. All the children were playing a little away from them. Only Varman was sitting very quietly near the elders, watching the children play.

"Hey Varma, why are you so quiet since coming from uncle's house? Did they scold you? Did you come back because of me?" his father asked, but he remained quiet without giving any answer.

Looking at his face, his father Sathyaventhan thought, "Someone at that house must have scolded him, so he came back angry," and said, "Look here, Varma, you shouldn't take everything the elders say the wrong way. Go, go and play with them."

He too said okay and went to play with the children.

In a short while, forgetting everything else, he was playing busily with the children when he saw his uncle Perumal looking at him. Shocked at seeing him, everything that happened last night came to his mind. Slightly scared, he suddenly ran toward where he had seen him. Nandhan also ran behind him.

Seeing both children suddenly running, Mangai too went near them saying "Something's wrong."

By then, everything was over.

Perumal, seeing Varman running, hid himself in a way that the boy couldn't see him from the side. When Varman came near him, without noticing Nandhan and his mother coming behind him, he pushed Varman down from the mountain and tried to move from there. Then a voice from behind him, "Brother!" made him turn back in shock. There, Nandhan was running fast looking at Varman. Not noticing the stone below, he stumbled and fell down. His head was hit hard, and he fainted falling down, both from the heavy bleeding and the fear of seeing Varman fall from the mountain.

The person who came first slapped his brother. "You sinner! You unjustly killed my son!" he kept asking while beating him repeatedly. By then everyone had come there hearing the sound.

Those who came there were shocked to see Nandhan lying in a pool of blood. The next moment, they took him and admitted him to the nearby hospital. Meanwhile, no one even checked if Varman was with them or not.

While Nandhan was being treated inside, everyone else was standing in front of that room saying, "What happened to Nandhan?"

Then Perumal, who was sitting alone and crying, took his sister away and said, "Mangai, forgive me. I had no other way than this. Varman knew all our secrets. Even though he's a small boy, you know about his horoscope, right? He has great intelligence. So, if he tells everything to those in the house, we'll get caught with the family. That's why I pushed him down from the mountain," he said, and Mangai was shocked.

"What... what are you saying?"

"Yes, dear. Last night I was performing puja and Varman saw it. He even saw me directly offering the sacrifice. Seeing that, he fainted right there. But when he woke up in the morning, he acted normally as if nothing happened. That's what scared me a bit. I knew then. With his intelligence, he must have stayed quiet thinking to somehow expose our secret. Also, he tried to tell Kesavan right away. I was there, so he couldn't tell. Even after this, if we leave him, definitely the hardship our family has suffered all these years will all go to waste. You leave this problem as it is, I'll take care of it," he said.

"But brother, he's my born son. How can I forget what happened in front of my eyes?" she cried. He consoled her saying this and that and brought her to where everyone was.

Just then, Vasanthi asked, "Varman is nowhere to be seen?" and everyone became anxious again. Then Mangai looked at her brother, and he said with his eyes, "I'll take care of it," and turned to everyone and said, "When Varman and Nandhan were fighting in play and when Nandhan pushed Varman, Varman lost his footing and fell down the mountain. I've told our people to search fully," he said without any hesitation. Everyone who heard what he said stood shocked.

Mangai, though saying her brother did this heinous act to save their secret, was crying in pain knowing who killed her born son but not being able to tell. Everyone there thought she was crying thinking about Varman. But only Mangai knows why she is crying. She's crying thinking of sacrificing her own son to save her birth home's secret. Such a mother.

Hearing what Perumal said, all the men immediately left from there and searched for five hours around the place where Varman was said to have fallen. But they couldn't find Varman anywhere. Finally, only Varman's torn shirt came into their hands.

At the same time, in the forest area of Poonsolai village, in the Shiva temple that only the Venthanar lineage has been worshipping for many years, Athikesavan, Valli, and Varman were standing in fear, while in front of them, a man-sized black king cobra stood with its hood raised.
