In a short while, the phone was answered from that side. "Dad, you know what's happening here? The Mara Varman you said died 20 years ago is standing alive here," she said.

The person on that side was shocked for a moment upon hearing that. "What are you saying? Is he alive? That's impossible. I myself pushed him from the mountain and made everyone believe all these years that his brother pushed him. Then how can he come alive?"

"Dad, it's because I just came seeing it with my own eyes that I'm saying it. Didn't I check properly?" Samshika said with slight emphasis.

"What should I do now?" her father asked.

"Dad, whether he's alive or not, it doesn't matter to us. Because the Suriyan mark belongs to Nandhavarman. So if we need to get what we want, we need Nandhavarman. Not Maravarman," said Samshika.

"What you're saying is right. All these years we've been waiting, and the reward is going to come to our hands in another two months. Until then, you watch your daughter and your husband carefully. I told you again and again, don't show your character to Nandhavarman. Adjust a bit until our work is done. But you hastily showed your true character to him, and not only did he chase you from the house, but he also divorced you," her father said angrily.

"Dad, there's no use talking about what's finished. No matter how much that Nandhan let go of my hand, Yathra is still in my hands. So it's easy to finish our work with her," said Samshika.

"Then one more important thing, Dad. That Maran has been living in this house under the name 'Nandhan' all these days. Even I couldn't identify that. Four days ago, saying important work, the one who went, today morning comes and stands with a girl. Also claiming her as his wife. Until then even I couldn't truly identify that he was Maran. Only after that did my ex-husband Nandhan come into the house. Even for a moment I was shocked. 'Who is this new person?' Then I found out he's my husband, and all these days Maran has been living in this house saying his name. Something seems wrong to me. The one who hasn't come to this town all these years and was thought to be not even alive has suddenly come, and he's come here when there are two months until Maha Shivaratri—something seems wrong to me, Dad," she said.

"Nothing like what you're thinking will be there. Without thinking about anything, just do the work I told you correctly. I'll take care of the rest," her father said and hung up the phone.

But in Samshika's mind, Maran's sudden coming was slightly irritating. Still, after her father said that, without thinking about it, she started planning how to make Nandhan fall into her trap.

At the same time, Varman, who angrily pulled Mitra's hand and came to his room, was still walking here and there in the room with his anger not subsiding, while she stood aside looking at him with fearful eyes.

Pavithra came and stood in front of him walking here and there. "Brother, Mother is calling you and sister-in-law downstairs," she said.

"For what?" he looked at his sister not understanding.

"It's something about performing a ritual. Mother is asking you to come," said Pavithra.

"Okay," said Varman and took Mitra and came down again. There, only the women of the house were present.

"Mangai, look, grandson and granddaughter-in-law have come. Take them to the pooja room," said Mangalammal.

The people who had spoken well to him when he was Nandhan, once they knew he was Maran, no one came forward to speak to him. He too didn't take it seriously.

As his mother-in-law said, taking them both to the pooja room, Mangai made Mitra light the lamp.

In a short while, all the rituals were completed, and everyone was sitting in the hall, when Maran's phone rang. Taking it to see who it was, his grandfather had called.

Taking the phone and standing at a distance, he answered, and he asked him to come up to Nandhan's room.

He too said "okay" to him, and without saying anything to his mother, telling Mitra "I'll talk to Grandfather and come," he left from there.

Sathya Venthan, who took Nandhan to his room, left his younger brother Chandra Venthan and left to see their daily work due to the problem that occurred at home. In a short while, Venthanar came to that room, and behind him, Maran also came.

Seeing Maran, Nandhan started shouting.

"Hey! Why are you shouting unnecessarily now? Didn't I tell you not to come here now? Who asked you to come here?" Maran looked angrily at his brother.

"Why should I listen to what you say?" Nandhan flared up.

"What? Wasn't the beating you got downstairs enough?" he said, cracking his knuckles and approaching him.

"Hey! Will you both stop fighting first! How big a problem am I talking about, and you both are fighting like small children," Venthanar scolded them both, and they stood glaring at each other silently.

"Grandpa, you called me on the phone and asked me to come to India. Then why did he kidnap me? Not only did he kidnap me, but he also tied me to a madwoman there," said Nandhan.

"Hey! How dare you suddenly call that girl mad? Don't you know who she is? Even knowing, how dare you call her mad?" Maran asked angrily.

"Will you both shut your mouths now or not? If the sound you're making is heard outside, all the trouble we've taken all these days will go to waste. So will you both be quiet for a while until I speak?" said Venthanar.

"Okay, leave it. The main reason I called you both to talk is about finding your younger uncle. Your elder uncle is coming tomorrow to leave his daughter here. He just called me and asked me to keep his daughter here for a few days. I also said okay. Maran, you also watch him well. I have doubts about him too. We found out that this girl and her father are the reason for all the problems. But we don't know who her father is. We need to find him soon," said Venthanar.

"You poor things! Are you all gang thieves? I thought what happened downstairs was real seeing the fight."

"Grandpa, why are you shouting unnecessarily now? You know what happened downstairs? Seeing the drama that happened downstairs, one woman would have called her father. Everyone is united in gang thievery. How did you catch that Samshika mookee for your grandson?" said Maran.

"Hey! For a moment, let me speak without you torturing me!" he said unable to bear what they were doing.

"Okay, tell us, Grandpa. What should you say now?" said Maran.

"Look here, Nandha, everything that happened downstairs was correct. But why did you kick Maran?" he asked.

"I kicked him innocently as a joke. But when I thought he would fall down, his wife standing next to him fell down and broke her head," said Nandhan.

"Hey! Speak respectfully! She's your sister-in-law! If you speak of her as 'her' or 'that' one more time, watch out!" said Maran.

"Mara, you too be a bit patient. He kicked you innocently as a joke. That's why why did you beat him until his face swelled?" Venthanar asked.

"Look here, Grandpa, I'll do everything you say, I'll listen patiently. But if anything happens to my Bappu, I won't spare anyone, even if it's you!" he said with slight emphasis.

"Yeah, great Bappu. As if you've been cooing over her since birth. You're talking as if you saw her only four hours ago. Already you have so much affection?" Nandhan asked mockingly.

"I may not have seen her for all these years. But when she first came to this world, it was by my hands that I received her. For all these years without seeing her, I've kept her alive in my chest," said Maran.

After hearing what he said, Nandhan didn't say anything else. He too knew his brother was crazy about his Bappu, yet he spoke to him a bit jokingly.

"Look here, I'm telling you again. I won't mind even if you interfere in any of my matters, but if you do anything in my Bappu's matter, I won't see you as a brother, I'll bury you alive!" he said angrily.

"Okay, leave it, Maran. The main reason I called you both to talk is about finding your younger uncle. Your elder uncle is coming tomorrow to leave his daughter here. He just called me and asked me to keep his daughter here for a few days. I also said okay. Maran, you also watch him well. I have doubts about him too. We found out that this girl and her father are the reason for all the problems. But we don't know who her father is. We need to find him soon," said Venthanar.

"You poor things! Are you all gang thieves? I thought what happened downstairs was real seeing the fight," thought someone watching all this.

"Grandpa, why are you shouting unnecessarily now? You know what? Do you know about the drama that happened downstairs? Seeing it, one woman would have called her father. Are you all united in gang thievery?" said Maran.

"Hey! Why suddenly call that girl mad? Don't you know who she is? Even knowing, how dare you call her mad?" said Maran angrily.

"Now will you both shut your mouths or not? If the sound you're making is heard outside, all the trouble we've taken will go to waste. So until I speak, will you both be quiet?" Venthanar asked.

"Okay, Grandpa. Whatever you tell us, we'll do," both said.

"Look, Nandha, now I'm asking you again. Why did you kick your brother like that?"

"He innocently kicked as a joke, Grandpa. It's my fault that I beat him," said Maran.

"Look here, I'm telling you both about an important matter now. Your younger uncle's daughter is coming here tomorrow. Watch her too. There's something wrong with that family. Also, find out soon who this Samshika's father is. Until we find out, both of you should act like you're fighting," said Venthanar.

"Okay, Grandpa," both said together.
