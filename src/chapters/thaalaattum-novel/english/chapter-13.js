  subtitle: "Sudden Revelation",
  content: `Sarathi looked at the woman who suddenly separated his younger sister from him in confusion, and within that confusion, Durga started shouting angrily at them. On top of that, addressing both of them with 'Da' (an informal way of addressing), anger arose in our Sarathi boy.

"Hey! Who are you talking to like that? If you continue, I'll talk to you the same way. Are you a girl? Why are you shouting like a street vendor!" When he shouted back at her in anger, Mitra stood caught between these two, just blinking.

She didn't find Sarathi's embrace wrong. It felt like the affection of a brother embracing his sister. So she didn't take that matter seriously. However, while she struggled to understand her own heart—wondering why she felt not even the slightest anger toward the man who had tied a thali around her neck without saying a single word to her, and instead felt a desire to remain in his embrace—she stood blinking at these two fighting between them, when Sarathi's phone rang to save her from them.

Sarathi too, without even looking at who was calling at this time, took the phone and put it to his ear. Upon hearing what was said from the other side, Sarathi was shocked.

Seeing Sarathi's face change after the phone call, Varman asked, "What?"

"He escaped from the place where we had locked him up," Sarathi said hesitantly and softly so only he could hear.

That was also heard by Valavan, who was nearby. Looking at them both suspiciously, when Varman noticed him, "Business matter," Varman brushed it off, and Valavan, who smiled slightly at that, said, "I know not only the truth about Mitra, but everything about you both," emphasizing the word "everything" slightly. At that, Sarathi looked at him shocked, while Varman looked at him without any expression.

"You must have been hiding your identity from everyone and living all these years because you have some problem. But now I'm sending Mitra with you trusting you. Nothing should happen to her," he said to both of them.

Going near Mitra, he gently stroked her head and said, "I thought I knew where to place you, but you've joined the hands you were meant to be with."

Without understanding what he said, both women looked at Valavan with confusion.

Noticing that, Valavan took Mitra's hand and placed it in Varman's hand, joining the locket in both their hands, and said, "This is your life hereafter, and also your true kinship. I came out of jail only to hand you over to this true relationship. I never thought it would happen automatically."

Only then did what he meant to say become clear to Mitra, and she looked at her husband shocked, while he looked at her and winked his eyes beautifully and smiled.

With everything that happened today being shocking events, Mitra stood silently not knowing what to say.

Looking at them both with satisfaction, Valavan brought the shocked Durga, who had been standing there, to his memory and explained the truth to her, telling her that she must stay with them from now on. With tears in her eyes, she embraced her friend, and Valavan and Durga left from there. Before leaving, he took their number saying he could be called for help at any time and gave his phone number before leaving.

After they both left that place, "Look here, Bappu, you may not understand what he said. But don't confuse your mind thinking about it. No matter what happens, you must have complete trust in me," Varman said with authority.

Her innate nature is to think about everything and make decisive decisions. The only decision she made without thinking was agreeing to marry the groom her father showed her. Otherwise, Mitra is someone who thinks patiently about everything and makes decisive decisions. From the moment he tied the thali around her neck, she had already decided that her life was with him. Now, after Valavan said what he did, she was firmly determined that her life was with him from now on.

"No matter what happens, the trust I have placed in you will never change," she said with determination, and seeing that, his heart struggled with an indescribable feeling.

Then Sarathi said, "Bappu, I'm your brother," and laughed, and she laughed too. But that laughter was only on her lips and not in her eyes.

No matter what, when told that those she had considered her family for all these years were not, she couldn't bear it at all.

After a while of their conversation, telling Sarathi, "Finish all the work here and come to town in two days," Varman left, taking Mitra with him.

In exactly two hours, they arrived in front of the Venthanar Palace where they had come from.

Without even noticing that the car had stopped, Mitra sat there as if in a trance.

"Mitra!" When Varman called, she turned toward him at his voice and looked at him as if asking "What?"

"Until I tell you the truth about who you are, no one here should know. You are the girl who belongs to this house. I will tell you when the time comes, okay?" he said.

With her trust in him, she nodded her head as if saying "okay" and got down from the car.

Without even noticing that there was a palace-like house in front of her, with what happened at the hall repeatedly coming to her memory and disturbing her heart, in that memory, not even noticing Varman holding her hand and taking her along, she went with him without feeling.

Since Varman had informed Venthanar beforehand that he was coming, Venthanar was sitting in a chair in front of the house with his wife, waiting for Varman's arrival.

Just then, Varman came and stood before them with his wife.

The first to see him was his grandmother Mangalammal. Shocked at seeing her grandson standing there, she called her daughters-in-law and sons. When everyone in the house came out wondering what was happening, they were shocked to see the heir of their house standing there.

The first to recover from that was his mother Mangai. "What is this, Varma? Who is this girl? Why did you bring her here?" Mangai asked her son, looking at the girl standing next to him with an emotionless face and a thali around her neck.

Unable to look at anyone's face and answer, for the first time in his life, he bowed his head and said to everyone in general, "She is my wife," in his authoritative voice.

Those in his house who were shocked to see him standing with his head bowed, reached the height of shock at the word "wife" he said next.

"Varma, do you know what you've done in the problem the house is facing now?" his father asked.

"I know, Dad! But I haven't done anything wrong. You trust me, don't you?" Varman said looking directly at his father.

"It's because I trust you that I haven't said a word to you even though so many problems have occurred in the house. But what you've done and come with now is not a simple matter. Do you know where this will lead you?" his father asked angrily.

"Whatever problem comes, I can face it, Dad," he said firmly.

With the unshakeable trust in his son, without saying anything else, "Mangai, bring the daughter-in-law inside," he ordered his wife, and taking everyone in his family with him, he went inside the house.

Mangai too performed the aarthi for her son and daughter-in-law with a reluctant smile. When asked to enter with their right foot first, Varman, holding his wife's hand tightly, took the right foot together and entered. The next moment, with a shout of "Daddy!" a tiny tot grabbed Varman's leg and stood there.

Even that she didn't feel, and Varman's wife stood next to him with that same emotionless face. Nothing happening here registered in her brain. It must be said that her thoughts were spinning around what happened at the hall to that extent.

But seeing that child holding Varman's leg, fear was on everyone's faces in Varman's family about "what will happen after this?"

"Yathra! Dad just came into the house, why are you already bothering him?" said Yathra's mother Samshika, coming dressed in clothes completely unsuitable for that house.

Looking at her, everyone's faces showed such revulsion. Yet, unable to show anything outside, they stood suppressing their anger.

"Daddy! Who is she? Why did she come to our house?" Yathra asked looking at the woman next to Varman.

The moment the child asked that, without any hesitation, embracing his wife with one hand and lifting Yathra with the other, "She is my wife. Your mother," said Varman.

Hearing what Varman said, Yathra, who screamed "No!", got down from Varman's hand, stood next to Samshika, and said, "She is my mother! She is not my mother!" angrily, that tiny tot.

Seeing Yathra speak, Shailu looked at Varman with contempt and thought to herself, "No matter how hard you try, you can't defeat me, Varma. Your daughter is going to help me complete what I came to do," and smiled cruelly.

Hearing what Yathra said, Varman glared at Samshika and said angrily, "Yathra! She is not your mother. She is your mother. From now on, you must call only her mother."

But, "I'm not someone who fears your anger," as if saying that, looking directly at her father, "I don't like her. I won't call her mother. I don't like her, and she shouldn't stay in this house either. Send her out of this house immediately!" she said angrily.

Varman looked at his daughter with shock, opposing him like this. Varman understood that in the days he wasn't here, Samshika had planted her purpose in his daughter's mind. Now Varman said patiently, "Look here, Yathra, Dad is telling you, from now on she is your mother."

At that moment, "Why should my daughter call strangers mother?" a man's voice angrily echoed at the doorway of the house. At that voice, everyone turned toward the doorway. Seeing the person standing there, everyone in the house froze, and Varman's mother fainted in shock and fell down.
