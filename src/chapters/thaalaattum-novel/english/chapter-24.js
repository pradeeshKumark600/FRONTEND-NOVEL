  content: `At the same time, Annadurai was shocked to hear the news of Valli's death in the hospital. What would they do without shaking if they heard the news that the person who had been talking to them so well for so long had died in the next ten minutes? Similarly, Annadurai was shocked to hear the news of Valli's death. 

Only now did he understand why Valli had changed the child. He knew very well that the person who had come to see him must have done something to the girl. Because of that, even after hearing the news of Valli's death, Annadurai did not even come close to him. He stayed away from him because he was afraid that if he came close they would find out about the child. 

A week after the birth of the child, the person who brought them home to their hometown, Dhenkar, thought, 'It is not good for them to stay in this town after this.' Since then he has done all the work to get out of here. Similarly, they arranged to sell all their properties, within three months they sold all the land, took the money and went to Madurai. 

Everything went well. Lakshmi also gave birth to a girl as her first child as she wished, so she named her Mithrayajini. After Tanuja and Roshan were born, Annadurai invested all the money he had and started a departmental store. When he started, he started small. After that, growing more and more and keeping the department store big and doing well, Mitra's character did not change at all when Mitra's mother, Sundari, at the age of 15, told Mitra things on her deathbed. But, a few qualities have changed. One of them, from that time till now, she had thought in her mind that the two children she had borne should go to Mitra, and she instilled it in her husband's mind. 

From then on, though he did not show much affection for Mitra, he spoke without hesitation and did not completely withdraw. After all, the first-born girl had an overwhelming love for her, didn't she? That's why he couldn't get rid of her altogether. 

Even when Mitra was of marriageable age, she was the first to be married. But Tanuja, who is infatuated with being a “foreign bridegroom” enters and plays a few games. 
In it, he unilaterally leans towards Lakshmi as his adopted daughter. 

Lo and behold, as a result of this, his beloved daughter Tanuja was scolding him and Lakshmi was not knowing how to pacify her. 

Tanuja shouted angrily, "Why did you remind her right after coming home? It's because of you that my husband can't even talk to me." 

Tanuja was screaming, "No, Tanuma, I have lost my mouth. Do I want to make you angry or make the groom sad?" 

Some time ago, after the wedding, Madesh's mother Chintamani, knowing that the bride and groom had come home, remained in her room to bring both the bride and groom home. 

He never came unless the time had passed for everyone to stand at the door waiting for him to come from home. So Lakshmi herself went inside and took the arati and wrapped the arati around both of them and said, “Mitramma, take your right foot and enter,” and uttered Mitra's name. That's it. The smiles that were on the faces of both the bride and groom all this time disappeared in the next second. Mathesh, who was the first to enter, looked around for his mother, but he could not find the person he was looking for. When he knew that "his mother must be in his room", Mathesh immediately took off the garland from his neck and put it on the sofa and went to his mother's room. 

Here she grabbed her mother's hand with so much anger on her face and dragged her into a room downstairs, screaming at her mother. 

Then Roshan entered the room and said, "Why are you scolding your mother unnecessarily? Do you get angry because of the dirty work you do?” Roshan asked tongue-in-cheek. 

“Dude, speak respectfully. Did I do a bad job? I got hold of him and asked him to marry me. Father and mother agreed. What's wrong with this?"

"What's so bad? Aren't you proud to say that you liked the groom that your sister saw? Despite this bad thing, good things have happened to my sister. Fortunately, my sister will not marry that man. He who marries such a beauty is not suitable for my sister," said Roshan and left the room. 

"He has a very long mouth. Let it be, or else I will kill him,” she muttered, staring at her mother and leaving the room. 

Here, Mathesh went to his mother's room and asked, “Mom... Emma is behaving like this? Do you like everything I like? I like Tanuja. I married her. Why do all this?" 

“Look here Mahesh, if you like Tanuja, you should have said it earlier. You should not have humiliated a girl to such an extent that you came to the wedding hall like this. Honestly, I didn't expect this from you. Please don't talk to me. I don't even want to look at your face. All the questions asked by Durga in the hall are true. Calling gold tin, put it away, let tin be gold now with you. You will understand it soon. Now go out of my room," Chintamani said and sat back. 

Not wanting to torment his mother by staying there again after his mother said so, Mathesh left the room and went to his room without seeing anyone there. 

Tanuja was annoyed to see Madesh going. "Even after marrying the one you love, you cannot be completely happy. She is the cause of everything. Let her come before me, then there is. Anyway, stay at home. It is far from home," she said, growing anger in her heart, and looked at her father-in-law. 

He also saw his daughter-in-law and said, "He is a little upset because his mother is talking to him? So he is a little disturbed. According to religion, there will be nothing. Go and rest for a while, Boma,” he sent her away. 

Both Annadurai and Lakshmi said, “We are also leaving, Samanthi. "Let's call the bridegroom to the other house after a good time," they said, leaving from there. 

Those who set out from there came straight to their homes, where they found the house just as they had left it the night before. The door was not even opened. Only then did Lakshmi realize that she had the house key. "I have the key, where is Mitra?" Thinking that, he opened the house with the key in his hand and went inside, Roshan asked his father the question that was in his mind. 

"The house is locked. So Durga must have gone home. Annadurai sent him away and fetch his sister, Roshan. Roshan was eager to see his sister right away and went to Durga's house immediately. Durga was sitting outside the house as if she was waiting for him. 

As Durga was sitting as if she didn't see Roshan coming, Roshan approached her directly, "Durga sister... where is sister?" He asked. 

That's all, Durga was furious. "Why, have you come to see if she is still alive?" 

"Why are you talking like this? What shall I do for all that they have done?” He asked with slightly confused eyes. 

"You don't have to do anything. But, just seeing you makes me happy. How did you all think to leave her in that situation? Do you think that no matter what you do, you remain silent, no matter what you do?" She asked angrily. 

“Durga, what will he do if you scold him for what he did? Like you, he came very happy to hear about his sister's wedding. Let go, whatever happened happened. Valavan came there saying that nothing is going to happen by talking about it. 

“Uncle, tell me. where is sister I want to see my sister," Roshan cried now.

Valawan remained silent as he did not know what to answer, Durga said, "You will not be able to see her anymore. She has gone where she is supposed to go. She will not come to that house again. You are the one who sent her away by calling her an 'orphan', right? You do not need her after this. You have gone where she wants to go. Don't look for her anymore." 

"Sister, I am scared to hear everything you are saying. Where is my sister? I want to see my sister right now. You are going to scare me by saying something. Stay, I will go immediately and fetch my father," Roshan cried and went to his house. 

Annadurai, who was sitting in the hall, eager to see his daughter, got up and looked at the gate, only his son was there. As his beloved daughter was nowhere to be found, he looked at Roshan and said, "Father, sister has gone somewhere? Sister Durga says that she will not come here anymore. You should come and ask me. I am afraid. Sister is not at home," he cried. 

At what he said, Annadurai stood like a statue, hearing what Roshan said from the kitchen, Lakshmi's vessel fell down in shock and made a noise. 

At the same time, here in Pooncholai village, Varman again throws a bomb to everyone's shock when they hear Satyavendan Valli's death attributed to Mangai. 

"This is shocking. It was not Nandan who pushed me off the mountain. It was someone else. My mother and I know who it is. Even if they know, they will not tell anyone who it is," Varman said while looking at his mother's face. 

Watching everything that was going on there, Mitra thought, "We've got caught up in some murderous crowd."
