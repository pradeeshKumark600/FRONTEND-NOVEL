  content: `"The habit of blaming others hasn't left you yet, has it, mother?" he said, emphasizing 'mother' slightly, which shocked Mangai.

With the same shock, Mangai looked at her son, and her son was also looking at her. "You don't know about me fully. I will never trust people who are very affectionate toward me. If they speak a little calmly and affectionately, you might believe them. But I will never believe you," he looked at his mother with disgust.

"Varma, now is not the time to talk about that. We should go to the temple immediately," said Varman's grandfather, Venthanar.

"No, grandfather, we have to talk now. Because only if those in the house know about them, they will stay away from them," Varman told his grandfather and looked at his father.

"What, Mr. Sathyaventhan? Will you tell about your wife yourself? Or should I tell?" he asked, and Sathyaventhan looked at his son with pain in his eyes.

"Looking like this, what can I do? You have to tell," he said and sat on the sofa there with his wife. Everyone looked at Sathyaventhan with confusion, "What?"

He too took a big breath and said, "Twenty years ago, it was Mangai who murdered Valli and the child in her womb," and everyone there was shocked. That matter was already known to Venthanar and Varman, so they didn't show shock hearing it.

Mitra screamed in shock, "What... murder?"
No one even noticed her screaming in shock. Everyone was frozen in shock to that extent.

"I learned this truth only a few years ago," he said, and Mangai glared at her husband angrily.

"So is it really true that Valli is not alive?" Vasanthi asked in shock.

Sathyaventhan nodded as if to say "No."

Valli was Mangai's own elder brother Athikesavan's wife.

A few years ago,

Mangai's father Janarthanan, mother Vadivukarasi. In Melaiyur village, their family, like Venthanar's family, was a traditional family.

This couple had two sons and one daughter.

First son Perumal, his wife Rama. Four years after marriage, they still don't have children.

Second son Athikesavan was studying in another town and working there. Today they have asked him to come to the village to see a girl for him.

Third daughter Mangai. Being the only female heir in that house, Janarthanan had blind love for her. If his daughter wished for anything, he would never refuse. That's how, when she saw the rich, educated Sathyaventhan from the neighboring village, Mangai liked him very much. Since they were already relatives, he got Mangai married to Sathyaventhan.

Nine years had passed since Mangai's marriage. She had twin sons, Maravarman and Nandhavarman. Both were turning eight.

Today, since they were going to see a girl for Janarthanan's second son Athikesavan, everyone at the Melaiyur palace was getting ready excitedly. Then a car came and stopped at the palace entrance, and from it, Mangai, her father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband, and their sons all got out.

"Father, has brother come?" Mangai entered the house with the question.

"Not yet, dear," her father told his daughter, and with a smile, invited his son-in-law and his parents inside Janarthanan.

After a brief pleasantry exchange inside, Sathyaventhan asked, "What uncle, we still haven't seen brother-in-law?"

"That's the thing, we don't know, son-in-law. There's still one hour of good time left. We still haven't seen Kesavan," he said and called his son again. When the phone didn't go through this time too, he got a bit anxious and told his elder son to go check.

He too called his younger brother's friend and inquired. They said Athikesavan had already left for the village, and he told this to his father.

Only after hearing that did Janarthanan feel a bit relieved. Then they heard the car sound outside. Just from the car sound, they knew who had come, and went outside with faces blooming after six months.

The joy of that couple eagerly awaiting their son was wiped away in an instant.

Because Athikesavan didn't come alone. Standing with him was his eight-month pregnant wife Valli.

"Father, forgive me. I got married without your knowledge due to circumstances," Athikesavan said, and Janarthanan silently entered the house without saying anything.

Perumal was the one who shouted about family honor and respect, and Sathyaventhan pacified him and took him inside.

As everyone went inside without inviting them into the house in anger, Varman was the one who invited his uncle and his wife inside.

When those who entered inside, no one said anything to them. Not wanting his father to be humiliated, Perumal called the girl's house, told them everything, and apologized.

Venthanar said, "The boy got married as he wished, accept them, Sambandhi."

"No, Sambandhi. If he had told this matter earlier, I wouldn't have looked for a girl for him. Now look, because of what he did, I have to bow my head in front of them," Janarthanan said with pain.

Then Perumal arrived and said, "Father, don't think about anything and worry. I spoke to them," and then said, "I have some work, I'll go out and come back," and glared at his brother and left from there.

Everyone was normal, only Mangai kept looking at Valli thoughtfully.

After a while, the Venthanar family talked and went to their house, and Athikesavan took his wife to his room.

Vadivukarasi, noticing that Perumal who went out hadn't returned even after night fell, told her husband and worried. Without giving any answer, Janarthanan lay down quietly.

Perumal, who came home at 11 pm at night, without anyone knowing, placed the object in his hand in the store room there and went to his room.

Two weeks passed quietly. As Valli's eight months were completed and the ninth month started, Vadivukarasi told her husband that they should perform the valakappu ceremony in the ninth month and introduce the younger daughter-in-law to the village.

What his wife said also seemed right, so he also agreed to perform the valakappu.

Since Valli had no family, Sathyaventhan said he would act as Valli's brother and do everything, and Athikesavan and Valli were overjoyed.

During that intervening period, Varman got very attached to Valli. He touched and touched the child in her womb and was delighted.

Nandhan didn't associate much with Athi, so he wouldn't come to their house. But Varman liked his uncle Athi more than his elder uncle, so he had great love for his wife and the child growing in her womb, staying in their house with them.

There were two more days for the valakappu. Everyone was sleeping that day, when Varman suddenly woke up.

Everywhere was dark. Looking at his uncle and aunt sleeping beside him, he got up silently, feeling a bit hungry. Remembering the ice cream he had bought in the evening, eager to eat it, he came out of the room.

Then he saw his elder uncle entering the house with wet clothes and going into the store room. Wanting to call "Uncle," he wanted to frighten and play with his uncle, so he went to the room he had gone to without making a sound, slowly opened the door, and shouted "Uncle." Seeing the event that happened there, he screamed in fear and fainted on the spot.

Athikesavan, who was sleeping well, woke up hearing Varman's sound. "What... it sounded like Varman screamed? He was sleeping right here, wasn't he?" he wondered and came out of the room without disturbing his wife. There, directly opposite, he saw his brother carrying Varman and going outside.

"Brother, what happened to Varman?" he went quickly to him, and he, not expecting him there at that time, was shocked.

Everything was just a few moments. Immediately not showing his shock, he said, "I went to Madurai town and just came back, Kesava. It rained on the way. So I got a bit wet. The light wasn't on, so when he saw me, he got scared and fainted. So I picked him up to take him to the hospital."

Athikesavan also believed what he said. "Okay, leave it, brother. He must have fainted in fear. Otherwise, there's nothing. Give him to me," he said and took Varman in his hands. Going up the stairs to his room carrying him, he suddenly turned and looked at his brother. He left from there without saying anything.

Perumal, watching both of them leave, with some anxiety on his face, went to his room. "What next? Varman saw him, didn't he?" he panicked and decided on a course of action, and slept that night having made a decision.

The next day, according to Perumal's plan, Varman fell from the mountain and died. But that blame fell on Nandhan.
