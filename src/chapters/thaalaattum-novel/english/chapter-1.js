  subtitle: "Poonsolai Village",
  content: `The trade routes winding through the southern part of Sivaganga district, the lush green lands soaked with sediment, the shadows cast by neem trees swaying like the clear music of the southern breeze… all these together formed Poonsolai.

Even the scent of the wind was different here.
Not just the smell of earth… this was the fragrance of affection.
A scent that moistens the heart with roots, intimacies, and memories.

Poonsolai was indeed a small village. But its uniqueness lay in its greenery, in its ancient glory.
This village, which sprouts green even in summer, transforms into a flowery breeze with the cool southern wind in winter, enchanting human hearts.

There stood a large palatial mansion... the palace of the Venthanar family. When the growing rays of the sun fell as long shadows, that old red brick doorway slowly opened.

Seven feet high, this iron-bound plow door—this was not just a house... it was history itself.

About six and a half acres of land surrounded the palace, with corn and rice stalks swaying in the wind everywhere. Small boulders displaying courage around the front of the house, slanted lush plants on the upper side, rows of coconut trees... everything seemed less like a house and more like a forest.

The three-story wooden structure faced the main entrance. Red curtains danced in the swirling wind through the mid-level windows. Mature coconut trees were planted on both sides. The entire house was filled with architecture reminiscent of ancient cities and traditional sculptures.

From the side of that grand mansion, an ancient golden bell began to ring. That palace of Poonsolai, surrounded by greenery... light slowly began to illuminate the entire house. In the middle of the green garden, as the sun cast its golden light, a fragrant breeze swept from the eastern entrance of the palace.

The sacred prayer room inside the palace—though small, its serenity matched the divinity of a temple. In the center of that room, the daughter-in-law of the house, Mangai, sat with complete devotion in her eyes, lighting a lamp with garland for the sandalwood-adorned Goddess Meenakshi, singing:

"In the land of Madurai, she gained glory
Meenakshi mother, companion of my life!"

Listening to this in rapture, her father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband, and brother-in-law—all four sat in the reception hall.

After the prayer, Mangai showed the ritual lamp to the head of the house, Venthanar, with an auspiciously smiling face. With the subtle pride characteristic of palace dwellers and a raised forehead, he bowed to the lamp with calm dignity.

Next, Venthanar's wife Mangalammal, beside her their eldest son Sathiya Venthan (Mangai's husband), and second son Chandra Venthan touched and worshipped the lamp.

After showing the lamp to everyone, Mangai placed it in the prayer room and walked toward the kitchen to bring tea for everyone.

Before she returned, let us learn about the people in that palace!

The eldest head of the house:

Venthanar and his wife Mangalammal have two sons and one daughter.

Eldest son Sathiya Venthan and his wife Mangai have a son Nandavarman (29), daughter Pavithra (20)

Second son Chandra Venthan and his wife Vasanthi have a son Sarvesh (27), daughter Kavya (20)

Third daughter Prabavathi and her husband Deivavirakash have sons Pragatheesh (27) and Pranav (24). That's all for now—we'll learn about the others as the story unfolds!

Shortly, Mangai came with coffee for everyone, served it to the three of them, and turned to go back to the kitchen to attend to breakfast. She saw a figure standing at the doorway and froze in shock—the tray in Mangai's hands fell to the ground.

At the loud sound of the tray hitting the floor, the three sitting there turned around.

Mangai stood motionless, eyes wide, staring at the doorway. A look they had never seen before... not fear... but... shock! The three of them noticed where her gaze had fixed.

They too, who had been smiling... suddenly stood up.
At the doorway... as the morning sunlight shone, reflecting that light on his face, stood a man.

Seeing him... with such joy
"It's him! He is the eldest heir of this house!" they all stood there, forgetting themselves.

From the kitchen, Chandra Venthan's wife Vasanthi also came out, hearing the commotion in the reception hall.

At that moment, relatives from every room began to wake up and slowly came to the reception hall, seeing them staring at the doorway, everyone went there.

From the moment he stood at the doorway, the entire palace seemed to have frozen.

In that cool breeze mixed with greenery floated a new fragrance... and the taste of an old memory.

With joy sparkling in his eyes, Sathiya Venthan was the first to move. After eight years, seeing his son, he widened his eyes and opened his heart, touched his son's face with two fingers...

"Varma..." he called his son softly.

But he! He stood silent. However, he gave him one look. What did that man see in that look! Immediately, Sathiya Venthan rushed forward and embraced his son.

As his hand embraced his son, something that had been lacking for so many years was filled, his heart told him, but he couldn't understand what it was.

At the same time, standing a little behind him, a heart began to beat rapidly.

With trembling legs, Mangai came near her son. Tears prevented words from forming. She looked at her son's face... the face she had seen only in photographs for eight years. But now it stood alive before her. Was it real? That mother's heart beat rapidly as she gently touched his cheek with her finger and caressed it, saying "Varma... Varma... is this... a dream...?" Realizing he was standing there, both her hands grabbed him and broke into sobs.
Like an evening downpour, as if the tunnels of the mind had opened.

The melody of that cry echoed soundlessly throughout the palace.

Everyone else stood watching that scene.

In that crowd, only one person's gaze changed. Venthanar,
The eldest head of that house.

He didn't move... standing at a distance, he observed his grandson very intensely.

There was no anger on his face. But there was another kind of turmoil. His gaze seemed as if he was seeing everyone there as a stranger and noticing each person for the first time.

The sharpness in his gaze...
A fire at the corner of his eyes...
For a moment, his body trembled.

"This look... I've seen this before... is he really my grandson?" his mind began to draw many lines.

The others standing at the doorway
Chandra Venthan, Vasanthi, Sarvesh, Pavithra, Kavya, Prabavathi, Deivavirakash, Pragatheesh, Pranav—everyone stood together, wordless, merely as spectators.

Among them, only Sarvesh asked Pragatheesh in doubt, softly so only he could hear, "Is this our Varma?"

"Why are you asking like that?" said Pragatheesh.

"His face looks like our Varman... but something seems different about him..." he said.

"Just keep quiet for a while! You're babbling nonsense," he silenced him and began to observe what was happening.

As people came to him one by one to speak, without speaking a single word, he just stood there keenly observing all the faces and didn't say a word.

When everyone noticed that he remained silent like that, while everyone was in different mental states, Venthanar's voice rang out at that palace entrance to break the tension.

"How long are you going to keep him standing there? Bring him inside," he said.

Following his words, when Mangai gently said to bring Nandavarman inside, "Come in, Varma," she said with a smiling face.

At that moment... from behind Varman, a five-year-old girl's voice called out "Daddy."

That word... the sound of peace that had been flowing in that house shattered the next instant like a stone falling into water.

Mangai's face, which had been blooming with a smile, became empty in an instant.

Everyone's eyes there searched for who owned that voice. A girl child of about 5 years old slowly came from behind her father and stood near him with a smile,
"Daddy... should I come too?... with you," she asked, holding Varman's hand and coaxing.

"Okay, dear, let's go inside, come," Varman picked up his daughter with a small smile and entered inside that palace.

Everyone couldn't understand for a moment what was happening. The man who had listened to everyone in Varman's family talk all this time without speaking a single word, now entered with a smile as soon as that child spoke—everyone was shocked to see this.

Sathiya Venthan just stood there... not a word.

Varman didn't even say the words "She is my daughter." But the "Daddy..." that came from that child's mouth...
That was enough for everyone to understand who she was.

Everyone there stood at the doorway watching Varman go inside the house. The one who went inside turned toward them and told his father, "Father, tell Marudhu to bring all our luggage and keep it in my room," and left from there. But in the word "Father" that he called, everyone froze in that same place.

The head of that palace, Venthanar, watched the departing Varman and became even more confused.

At the same time, in the palace... at a distance, in a corner of that same Poonsolai, an old bicycle leaned against a rope-tied post. That place had hidden traces of emotions unknown to others. An old man sitting there laughed heartily and said, "This is just the beginning, Venthanar," and laughed.

This was not just a Poonsolai village... this was the beginning of a story. Not just a family's tradition, but the secrets of many generations were buried within its walls.
