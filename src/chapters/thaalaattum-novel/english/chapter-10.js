  subtitle: "Revelations at Dawn",
  content: `4 AM in the bridal chamber. As a few voices could be heard in the wedding hall, our heroine Mitra, who had been sleeping, just woke up. Today was her wedding day. Her friend Durga woke Mitra up and told her to get ready for the wedding.

Mitra went to the bathroom, bathed, and came out. Her future mother-in-law entered the room with a beautician.

"This is my daughter-in-law. You need to get her ready, okay? There's plenty of time until the auspicious moment, so take your time and make her beautiful," she said and left the room.

The beautician seated Mitra and was beautifully displaying her makeup artistry when someone knocked hard on the door from outside. Durga went and opened the door.

Valavan stood there, showing no emotion on his face.

Seeing Valavan outside, Durga turned her face away and went inside.

Since childhood, Mitra, Durga, and Valavan had been close friends despite their age differences. Roshan wasn't with them as he grew up in a hostel. Thanuja never liked Valavan. The main reason for that was Valavan treated Mitra well.

At the age of 27, Valavan married a girl he loved.

Neither Mitra nor Durga liked that girl at all. Valavan married her despite their opposition.

No one knows what happened, but within a year of marriage, the police arrested him saying he had killed his wife.

It was shocking for both friends. They knew there definitely couldn't be any fault on their friend's part. Still, angry that he married her despite all their warnings, they hadn't spoken to him all these days. But after hearing this news, they couldn't stay without talking to him. So both of them went and met him.

The only words he said were "Please forgive me."

After that, he didn't speak a word and didn't meet anyone. After all these years, he came out of jail just four days before Mitra's wedding. When his sister went and met him in jail and said something, he immediately came out.

Since coming out, Mitra, Durga, and Valavan hadn't spoken a single word to each other. He too, thinking something in his mind, didn't speak to either of them.

"Mitra... I need to talk to you a bit," Valavan said in an emotionless voice.

When he said that, Mitra turned and looked at the beautician. The woman also said she would go have coffee and left the room.

As soon as the woman left, Valavan bolted the room door and approached Mitra. Grabbing her hand, "Leave this hall immediately. He's not the one for you. If you stay in this hall a little longer, seeing what happens next will break your heart," he said.

Hearing what he said, both Mitra and Durga looked at him in confusion.

"Uncle, what happened? Why are you talking like this? In a little while, I'm going to get married. Now you come and say, 'He's not the one for you.' How many days has it been since you came out of jail? Have you spoken a single word to me?" Mitra asked, starting angrily but ending with a broken voice, hurt that he hadn't spoken.

Valavan knew that too. He knew that if he didn't speak, Mitra would definitely be hurt. Even knowing that, there was only one reason he remained silent—for her to be safe until he handed her over to the one meant for her.

Now he didn't need to be silent. Because the one meant for her had come searching for her. This wedding would definitely happen today. Both of them would leave this Madurai land together and go to their ancestral place, his inner voice said. That's why he told her to leave the hall immediately.

"Whatever it is, explain it so we can understand. Don't speak in riddles like this—it's irritating me," Durga snapped a bit.

Looking back at her, Valavan clearly saw the anger she had toward him. Though it pained his heart to see it, thinking that wasn't important now, he began to tell Mitra what his sister had told him when she came to the jail.

"Valava, they came to see Mitra for a bride viewing. As soon as we saw that groom, we all liked him. So the groom's family immediately said let's fix the wedding, and we agreed. Four days before the engagement, Thanuja locked me and your father in a dark room with a knife in her hand. She threatened us saying 'I want only Mathesh, I won't marry anyone else.' We didn't know what to do. At that time, we agreed to what she said.

"As soon as we agreed, Thanuja told the groom about this matter, and the groom got a bit angry.

"That day she came crying and told us. We were happy thinking this problem was over. But the very next day, the groom called and said he agreed to marry our younger daughter.

"After Thanuja spoke with the groom, the friends who were with the groom changed the groom's mind by saying various things like Mitra isn't modern enough, dresses simply in saree, so she can't live abroad with him. We didn't know what to do."

"But! After Thanuja heard this, she insisted that if she married, she would only marry Mathesh. Because of my affection for Thanuja, I told your uncle, 'Let our daughter live the life she likes, we can find another groom for Mitra and get her married.' When he said it was absolutely impossible, in a fit of anger, I said, 'Mitra isn't our daughter, she's an orphan. But without caring for our biological daughter Thanuja's life, you're thinking about that orphan.'

"Hearing what I said, Thanuja learned all the truth too. After that, we couldn't control Thanuja at all. So we had to nod to everything she said. We convinced the groom's father about this matter using the groom. Only the groom's mother doesn't know."

Hearing everything she said, Valavan calmly looked at his sister and asked, "What's the connection between the story you're telling now and why you came to see me?"

"It's nothing, Valava? You've liked Mitra since childhood. She likes you too. Both of you always hang around together. We built hope in her saying she's getting married. Where will she find a groom at the last moment? That's why..." Lakshmi hesitated a bit to continue.

"That's why?" Valavan asked, grinding his teeth.

"That's why you marry our Mitra yourself, Valava," said Lakshmi.

Hearing that, his eyes filled with so much anger. If anyone else had talked to him about this at this time, he would have destroyed them right there without a trace. But it was his own sister asking, wasn't it? So he controlled his anger.

"Look here, Valava? I've also gotten the groom's father to agree to get you out. He said he'll hire a big lawyer and get you out. So you must agree to come out without saying anything else, okay?" said Lakshmi.

The one who had been listening and getting angry all this time made some other decision in his mind and said only, "I agree to come out."

He didn't say he would marry. But Lakshmi thought he had agreed to marry and happily took steps to get him out.

"This is what happened," he finished telling everything. Both women stood there frozen, speechless in shock.

Durga, more angry, without even considering that he was older than her in age, slapped Valavan hard.

Valavan was stunned by Durga's slap. Looking up, Durga was burning him with her eyes in anger.

"Where did your sense go when your sister told you? Don't you have any shame coming out of jail to marry? Pfft... are you even human?" Durga asked angrily.

"Durga, don't speak without understanding! I only said I'd come out. I didn't say I'm going to marry Mitra!" Valavan also got angry.

While both glared at each other, nearby Mitra's face showed so much sorrow. With that same sorrow, she left that room and went to where her mother and father were. There, her mother Lakshmi was laughing and talking among relatives.

As soon as she saw her, she went near her and called, "Mother..."

Lakshmi was startled at her voice and turned around. With the auspicious time set for 6 o'clock for her younger daughter, seeing her standing here now was a bit shocking. Still, without showing it outwardly, "What is it, Mitra? What are you doing here at this time? The bride shouldn't come outside like this," she said affectionately.

"Mother, if Thanu liked him, she could have told me directly, right? Why did you deceive me, Mother?" she asked with a broken voice.

Shocked by that, Lakshmi looked at Mitra's face. They had just applied makeup, but because she cried, her eyes were red and kajal smudged, looking pitiful. Though she didn't say what exactly, she understood—Mitra knew everything.

Telling the person next to her, "Wait a minute, I'll be back," she took Mitra a little distance away. "Don't make any problems, Mitra. Your sister's wedding is going to happen in a little while. Don't spoil the wedding by talking about all this at this time," she said.

While she was speaking, Mathesh's mother Chintamani came near them and glared at Lakshmi. "What kind of mother are you all? No mother would do such an act. If your younger daughter liked my son, you should have told Mitra directly or told me directly. Instead of that, you talked to my young son and my husband, confused their minds, and tried to conduct this wedding. What kind of people are you?" she shouted.

Everyone in the hall looked at them. Lakshmi, afraid that there would be a problem, "Samandhi Mother... speak softly please. Everyone is looking at us," she said.

"Let them look! Only then will everyone know your true nature. As a family, you deceived me. You even brought my son and husband into this. Don't you have any shame?" said Chintamani.

"Samandhi Mother, don't speak wrongly. Both children liked each other, so we thought of bringing them together," said Lakshmi.

"Don't you feel ashamed to say this?" While Chintamani kept shouting, her husband came to that place and tried to calm his wife down.

"You don't speak! How could you deceive this girl?" he asked sorrowfully.

"Mani, this isn't the time to talk about that. Look there, your son is sitting on the wedding platform. The wedding is in a little while. Are you going to make problems now?" he said.

"No matter what happens, Mitra is my daughter-in-law! No one can change that no matter what they think!" said Chintamani stubbornly.

When she said that, Lakshmi got angry. "Enough, Samandhi, stop! What fault did you find in the younger daughter?"

"What fault, you ask? Wanting to marry the groom chosen for her elder sister itself is shameful! Isn't that one reason enough?" said Chintamani.
