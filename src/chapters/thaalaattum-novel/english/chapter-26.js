From what he said, it was clear that what he said as 'aunt' was the mother who gave birth to him. Immediately she wiped her eye without anyone knowing and stood quietly. Varman was watching everything. He remained calm thinking that 'even now if he gets closer, the truth of who she is will be known to the people here.' 

Then, "You idiot! Have you lied to me for so many years?" The one who asked her brother and went to her husband said, "Why, I don't know anything about what Varman is saying. I didn't do anything wrong. The only mistake I made was that he was trying to interfere with me for so long. That's all. According to religion, I didn't do anything wrong," cried Mangai. 

"So what did you do wrong?" Varman looked sharply at his mother. 

Mangai was embarrassed to say that mistake in front of her sons. However, the person who thought that it would not be good not to tell the truth after this, thought, 'It doesn't matter if they think she is ugly, she can tell all the truth about herself,' Mangai thought that she fell in love with the boy who studied with her when she was a child and thought of getting married, only then did she know that he was poor and said, "I don't like him." After that, Mangaiyammal also told her brother to force him to marry her by showing her photographs of the boy. 
No matter how much Perumal talked to the boy about his affection for his younger sister, Perumal killed him at one point so that he would not lose his temper. At first Mangai was scared when she told her sister, then she thought, 'His trouble will be no more' and then crawled away happily, only then did Satyavendan catch her eye. 

Immediately after seeing him, he got hold of him, told his father about it and married him. 

Because of this, Perumal kept him in his favor for so many years. 
The one who spoke all the truth stood without looking up at anyone's face, but Satyavendan, who was close to him, let out a slap. To the point of tearing the ear. A man who had not reached out for a single day in all these years of marriage, for the first time everyone in the house had slapped him with anger towards his wife. 

"Hey big guy! Is this a new habit? The habit of hitting the boy with his hand?" Mangaiyammal scolded her son. 

"Then what? If she had told me before the wedding without concealing her wrongdoing, would I have had so much trouble? By now she is dead with two other people. My son has passed away. It has been so many years. Who is all this? She was the only one who told him about her, and her brother too. "I don't know if Kesavan Machan is alive all these years," said Satyavendan, who shouted angrily at his wife and went straight to Perumal, who was 'elder in age' and 'wife's brother'. 

"Are you a human being? Are you so mad that you would kill your father, your half-brother, your brother's wife, all of them?" Satyavendan, who shouted angrily, looked at his son Varman and said, "Whatever you want to do from now on, I will not stop you from doing anything. I will also tell you about your mother. From now on, everyone in this house should listen to what you say," and angrily went near him. 

All the girls took one look at Mangai and went to their rooms, only the men were there. 

"Varma, have you decided what to do? Looking at all the work they have done, the matter seems a little serious. It is not right for me to leave it like this," Deivaprakash said. 

"You are right, uncle. I have a doubt that they have done all this. I feel that there is someone behind them. It is dangerous for us to let them out until we know that," said Varman, looking at Nandan and telling him some things, he told him to do it immediately.

As Varman said, Nandan got down to the job immediately. "I will not go with him," said Nandan, who was dragged away by four servants. He also now somewhat understood why his wife had stayed with him for so many years. 

When Nandan left there, he said, "Grandpa, a special pooja is being organized in our village temple tomorrow. Tell everyone to be ready for it. We have a little surprise for everyone after going to our temple," and Varman left. 

"Still a surprise?" Deiva Prakash thought, "Machan, every day there are shocks in this house. What shock is your brother waiting to give tomorrow?" He looked at Chandravendan and left. 
Chandravendan took one look at his father and left for the field. Only Vendanar was sitting on the sofa there thinking about something. 

He knew better. From what his father told him, he can get the power to destroy many evil spirits through that pooja. The same power cannot defeat the evil ones if they attain them. His father had heard that at the end of the pooja, a powerful fire called Agni Chuji would be lit. It is well understood that they have worked so hard to achieve that. 

There were still 21 days left for Maha Shivratri, and he was a little afraid of how many more problems would come. 

Here Mitra was crying in Varman's room and Varman was comforting her. 

"Don't look here, you must never cry again. When you were born, I bought you with this hand. When I bought you, I thought, 'I will always hold you in this hand.'" I'm sorry," said Varman, smiling and hugging her. 

"They are the ones who told everyone that I am dead. Then how do you know that I am still alive?" she asked wiping her eyes. 

"I also thought you were dead then. It was only ten years ago that we knew you were alive. 
I came to know one day when my grandfather told me that my aunt had a boy and 'died at birth'. Aunty has lied something to protect you. We have been looking for you from mother without anyone knowing." 

"In all these years, I have not talked to anyone much. I will not talk to anyone except Durga, Valavan Mama and these people. I agreed to marry Madesh not because I like him. I agreed to the marriage only because my father told me. Not right. I had a feeling then, but I didn't even think that my father would cheat on me. Whatever it is, it's a girl, Mitra looked at her husband in confusion. 

He also felt sad for her. "Don't stay here, papu, you shouldn't be upset about anything. It's like we both don't have enough money to grow up even as children. Even for you, both 'father and mother' have been with you for so long. But I know the pain of seeing them standing there, unable to go to them," he said casually with pain in his eyes. 

'For all these years we were happy with them, thinking that they were her father and mother. But, this man...' she felt sad. Mitra seemed to think that God would not give anyone a life without flaws. Not liking the sad look on his face, to call him "Mama," he must say he was stunned with happiness for a second. 

"What? What did you call?" Turning to look at Mitra, Mitra nodded and said, "I called you uncle. Why, don't you like it when I call you uncle?" rolling her eggy eyes and saying,

Varman thought that he would get lost in those eyes. "Do you know how many years I have been waiting for this word 'Mama'?" He smiled beautifully. 

"Honey, uncle, I want to ask you something, will you give it to me?" Mitra asked in eager tongues, not even knowing what he was asking and she shook her head as if to 'give'. 

When Mitra said 'I'll give', he immediately stood up and spoke the language of love with his wife's eyes, "Will you give me just one kiss for this uncle?" He asked. 

Mitra, who thought he was going to ask for something else, who suddenly didn't expect him to ask for a kiss, his cheeks turned red and her face began to sweat. 

"What's wrong honey, uncle said 'I'll give you right away' when he asked? Are you thinking so much now? Maybe you don't like me?" Mitra asked sadly, unable to bear his grief, she gave him a kiss on the cheek before he took off and entered the bathroom from there. 

Varman asked 'What?' He gave her a kiss and ran away before he could even think about it, he was first stunned by her kiss, then he shook his head to hide his pride as he looked at the bathroom she joined. In the same happiness, he called Prakadish and asked him to bring everyone home. 

The next morning dawned beautifully. Everyone in the house got ready to go to the temple, but only Mangai stayed in her room. No one spoke a word to Mangai even when Vendanar told them about everyone going to the temple last night. Even Satyavendan did not like to go to the room where the monk was, but stayed in another room there and used to get ready from there in the morning. 

Even though he did not come, no one forced him to come. "What's up Varma, everyone has come, only you and Bondati will see each other. How long will you be ready?" asked his aunt, 

"I don't know, aunty. I left on time to go to the temple and come home to collect you, but I haven't come home yet. Wait, I'll go and see what's going on," he said and went upstairs to fetch his wife. Just then, his wife Mithrayashini came down from her room. 

Mitra came down the steps like an angel in a golden and silver embroidered silk sari, wearing the yellow rope she had worn on her wedding day and a small aura around her neck, with a bun on her forehead, a few gray hairs in a single braid, and fragrant jasmine in it, and without any make-up. 

Varman froze when he saw his wife walking like an angel. Not only him, but also the people below. Even yesterday she was wearing a disheveled sari and her head was disheveled, so they didn't know her true beauty, but now they were surprised to see that she had taken a normal bath and was wearing a new sari. 

Mitra was coming down and was looking at her husband without blinking. Varman came to his senses as she came down, gazing at the handsome beauty of her husband, who was majestic in his silk shirt, and stood close to him. 

"Brother, that's enough. It's time. Go to the temple and kiss your sister on the side. Let's go to the temple now," said Sarvesh, and the laughter reached Mangai's room. Varman was beautifully embarrassed by their laughter. 

"Okay, it's time. Everyone can go," called Vendanar, "wait a minute, grandpa. More important people have to come," Nandan said while looking at Nandan. 

"Varma, that's why you said she was coming. Why do you think she's coming? She's not that important," Satyavendan said angrily. 

"Father, I will not tell them anything. They are very important. You are going to have a second daughter-in-law," said Varman, "Machan!" A quill's voice was heard at the door. 

As Nandan stood with his back turned, the woman called "Machan" ran to hug Nandan, and everyone in the house was shocked.
