  content: `As soon as Varman left the house, Venthanar told the servant there to show Samshika a room to stay in.

A servant there took Samshika's luggage and went ahead. She too approached to take Yathra from Sarvesh.

At that time, Varman's father signaled to his daughter with his eyes. Pavithra too came and stood in front of Sarvesh, shielding them both.

"Hey, idiot! Why are you standing in front of me?" Samshika asked somewhat irritably.

"Didn't you understand what my brother said? Or are you pretending not to understand?" said Pavithra without any fear on her face.

"I don't need to act for you. Move aside properly! I'm taking my daughter and going to my room," said Samshika.

Hearing that, Mangai said, "Listen here, ma! My son clearly said, didn't he? My granddaughter shouldn't stay in your room. So why are you making a problem?"

"Grandma! I'll stay with my Mommy. I can't stay without Mommy!" she told her grandmother.

At that question, little Yathra said to her father, holding on to Samshika's hand, "I'll stay with my Mommy!" and took her mother's hand and led her to the room assigned to Samshika.

A satisfied smile bloomed on Samshika's face seeing Yathra's action.

Everyone in the house looked at each other in shock.

Suddenly, Yathra's behavior seemed different to the others. She who had been standing quietly in fear after hearing Varman speak angrily, suddenly spoke and left as if under some spell—they watched in shock.

"This girl shouldn't have been allowed into our house at all. From the moment I saw her, my heart feels something is wrong," said Mangai.

"What's the use of lamenting now? Your son should have thought about all this when he married her. Now it's too late to worry about whether it's wrong or not. Leave it, Mangai. Whatever is meant to happen will happen," said her mother-in-law, and invited everyone to eat. Others too left from there without saying anything.

Only Venthanar sat at that same place, thinking deeply about something.

Here, having left home, within an hour Varman reached the hotel his friend had mentioned.

There, his friend Sarathi had been waiting for him alone in a private room for a long time. A young man aged 29. His dark complexion, long slightly disheveled hair, beard and mustache gave him a charming appearance. Sharp eyes, a gaze that always seemed to be analyzing something, showed he was a thinker. Though he had a slim build, the firmness in his shoulders showed he was strong. Though he wore ordinary jeans and a t-shirt, a deep intelligence was hidden within his simple appearance.

When Varman came to the room, he saw his friend sitting there. Sarathi too embraced Varman warmly as soon as he saw him. The one who had been everything to him since childhood, whom he had never been separated from even once. This was the first time he was separated from him. Having been separated from him, Sarathi got a little emotional and hugged him. That embrace contained the depth of many years of bonding and a kind of pain from unexpected separation.

Varman too smiled slightly and hugged him, making him sit in the chair next to him. Then the server who entered that room spread their food on the table and left. Shortly after finishing their breakfast, both sat on the sofa there.

"Okay, tell me. How much have you found out?" Varman got straight to the point.

"Varma, I've got information up to when they came to Madurai. After that, I haven't been able to get any news. Now we need to gather all the rest of the information," said Sarathi.

"We don't have much time, Sarathi. I have to go back to town in three days. When I go back to town, I have to go with her," said Varman.

"And another thing... what I didn't expect... this morning, Yathra's mother came to the house," he said calmly.

"What are you saying? This morning, news came to me that she had canceled her flight ticket. That's why I immediately called you and told you," said Sarathi in confusion.

"There's nothing to be confused about in this. Last night, news that Grandfather was going to hand over all responsibilities to me became known to her somehow. That's why she canceled the flight ticket she had booked and came here by her boyfriend's flight," said Varman.

"What are you saying? So David has come here too?" Sarathi asked in shock.

"He didn't come. Only she came. But he'll come here soon. Before he comes here, we somehow have to find my uncle. Only then can we foil her plan," said Varman with a kind of pressure.

"Don't you have even a small clue about where your uncle is?" Sarathi asked.

"No, da. I tried so much. Even last night, I got a small bit of information. When I went and looked there, someone else was there in his name," said Varman, conveying the failure of his attempts.

"Okay, leave all that problem. Now finding that girl is important," said Sarathi.

"Okay, tell your people to immediately collect information about everyone who came to Madurai on the date I mentioned," he said. After some more conversation, both of them left from there.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Only two more days remained until Mitra's wedding.

Wedding work was going on busily throughout the house. More than Mitra, the bride, her younger sister Thanuja was the one who was very busy with clothes, jewelry, facials, etc. Even though Durga called many times, Mitra refused to come to the parlor. Durga too didn't force her and let it go.

For the three days since Valavan came to the house, Mitra's father Annadurai had been secretly pleading with him without anyone knowing. But Valavan gave him no answer, giving only his silence as a reply. The desperation in Annadurai's eyes created no stir within Valavan.

Only the day before the wedding did Mitra's younger brother Roshan come home from the hostel. He liked Mitra much more than Thanuja. Ever since he learned that his beloved sister was getting married, he had been so happy. He had given invitations to all his college friends, insisting they come to the wedding, and had come home.

Tomorrow is the wedding. But Varman still hasn't been able to find the girl he was searching for. Having said he would return to town in three days, four days had passed. Perhaps thinking that if he let it go now, they would lose her without finding her, he kept wandering around without even taking a moment's rest. Every street, every piece of information gave him new hope. But all of them ended only in disappointment in the end.

At Mitra's house, everyone had left to go to the wedding hall since the wedding was tomorrow.

At the groom's house, since Mathesh and his father had invited only their close relatives, only key members were present at that hall from the groom's side. Even Mathesh's mother was consoled with various excuses about why they had invited only their close relatives to the wedding. For some reason, on Mathesh's face, which had no happiness at all on the engagement day, there was happiness now.

That day, there wasn't even the little bit of happiness that had been there on Mitra's face. The thoughts running through her mind were clearly visible on her face.

At the wedding hall, in the evening, all kinds of rituals, music programs, and dances ended in celebration.

Under the spectacular lighting, relatives chatted and laughed enthusiastically. Children and youth danced and enjoyed. Elders were consulting about rituals. While all this was happening on one side, Mathesh and Mitra sat in the midst of that commotion with a kind of detachment.

The noise of the night subsided, and dawn slowly broke. Through the large windows of the hall, the gentle light of dawn, mixed with the fragrance of flowers and the freshness of a new day, spread throughout the hall. Along with it, some murmurs.

"What's this! They called saying it's a wedding for the elder sister—here, the younger sister is getting married!" someone in the hall asked in shock.

"I knew it already! During the engagement itself, this groom was holding the younger sister's hand after putting the ring on the elder sister. I thought maybe it looked wrong to my cursed eyes. Only now do I know about their whole scheme. Poor girl—not only did the wedding not happen even after coming to the wedding stage, but he's tying the thali to her younger sister right in front of her. Will he be well at all?" lamented their neighbor lady.

"The younger sister liked the groom who was chosen for the elder sister, so they're marrying this girl off leaving that girl. Whatever they say, a raised daughter is a raised daughter, a born daughter is a born daughter—did you see?" said another person.

While people in the hall were saying various things, the girl—that is, Mitra—sat on the chair below the stage without any emotion, watching the two people on the stage who were smiling in fake happiness.

"Is there anger on her face?" If asked, definitely not.

But! She was lifeless even while alive.
