Venthanar called his son Sathiya Devan as soon as he woke up in the morning. "Sathiya, today we all need to talk together."

"What's the matter, Father?" Sathiya Devan asked.

"About Varma. About his problem. Call everyone," Venthanar said.

Soon, the entire family gathered in the hall. Sathiya Devan, his wife Mangai, their sons Pranav and Sarvesh, Pavithra—everyone sat around Venthanar.

"Grandfather, what's the matter?" Pranav asked.

Venthanar looked at his family members. "Yesterday Varma told me everything. About his wife's matter."

"What did he say, Father?" Sathiya Devan asked eagerly.

"His wife deceived him. With someone else..." Venthanar began to say.

"What!" Mangai exclaimed in shock. "Is this true?"

"Varma said so. He saw it with his own eyes," Venthanar explained.

"That's why he hit her?" Sarvesh asked.

"Yes. He lost control in anger and hit her. That's why she left him," Venthanar said.

There was silence for a moment. Then Sathiya Devan began to speak. "Father, how do we know what's true in this? Varma says one thing. We don't know what his wife will say."

"That's what I thought too, Sathiya. That's why we need to find her too. We have to hear both sides before making a decision," Venthanar said.

"But where is she? Even Varma doesn't know," Mangai asked.

"That's why we need to find her. Sarvesh, Pranav, you two go and find out. Inquire at her parents' house, friends, everywhere," Venthanar ordered.

"Okay, Grandfather," both brothers said together.

"Father, should we tell Varma about all this?" Sathiya Devan asked.

"No. He's already under great stress. We can tell him after we find out," Venthanar said.

Then a small footstep sound was heard. Everyone turned and looked. There stood little Yathra, tears in her eyes.

"Yathra!" Mangai rushed and picked up the child. "Why are you crying, dear?"

"Grandma... I want mother. Where is mother?" the child asked.

Everyone's heart trembled. What answer to give to this small child?

Venthanar called that child near him. "Yathra, your mother will come in a few days. Until then, you stay with us, okay?"

"When will she come, Grandfather?" the child asked innocently.

"Soon, dear. If you're a good girl, your mother will come quickly," Venthanar said affectionately.

The child slowly nodded. But no one could hide the sadness in her eyes.

That evening, Pranav and Sarvesh went to Varman's wife's parents' house. There, Varman's father-in-law received them.

"Who are you?" he asked.

"Uncle, we're Varma's brothers. We came to see our sister-in-law," Sarvesh said.

The father-in-law's face hardened. "She's not here. I know what your brother did. Don't look for her."

"But uncle, we need to talk a bit. Please," Pranav pleaded.

"Go. Don't want here," the father-in-law tried to close the door.

Then a woman's voice was heard. "Father, who is it?"

That was Varman's wife's voice. Sarvesh spoke quickly. "Sister-in-law, we're Varma's brothers. We need to see you for a bit."

"I don't want to see anyone. Go," she said sternly.

"Sister-in-law, please. For Yathra's sake. For your child's sake," Pranav said.

"Is Yathra okay?" worry was evident in her voice.

"Yes, sister-in-law. But she misses you a lot. Please, can we talk for a bit?" Sarvesh asked.

A moment of silence. Then the door opened. There stood Varman's wife. Her eyes were red, her face had faded.

"What do you want to talk about?" she asked.

"Can we come inside?" Pranav asked.

She hesitated. Then nodded. They went inside.

"Sister-in-law, we came to find out the truth. Varma said you... him..." Sarvesh began.

"I deceived him?" she laughed. But it was a bitter laugh. "He'll think that. But the truth is different."

"What's the truth, sister-in-law?" Pranav asked.

She took a deep breath. "I'll tell you. But will you believe me?"
