  subtitle: "Nandhan's Past Unveiled",
  content: `For a long time, the three of them talked, and realizing time had passed, Maran and his grandfather left Nandhan's room.

After they both left, Nandhan recalled his past life.

Nandhan had gone abroad from Poonsolai village to pursue his higher studies, and his life had gone normally for two years, calling home occasionally.

When Samshika entered his life, that's when his habits began to change. As the first sign of this, he stopped calling home. Even when they called, he wouldn't speak properly and would hang up immediately.

As days passed, Samshika gradually introduced him to habits like pubs and alcohol, which became his daily routine.

One day, intoxicated with alcohol and with the poison called Samshika who was with him, he lost his life, and that day, Saturday caught him.

At first, nodding to everything she said as his girlfriend, without knowing her true nature, he started a business in her name. In the midst of this, when Samshika became pregnant, he had to marry her.

Everything was going well, and after Yathra was born, when she was four years old, her true nature came to light.

She who was always secretly talking to her father, that day Nandhan had said he would return only in the evening for a business meeting, so she called her father and was discussing their next plan—that through Nandhan and Yathra, they should control the Agni Suli pooja of Shiva, which would be performed by the heir with the Surya mark of the Venthanar family. When Nandhan came back to get the file he had forgotten for the meeting, he heard everything.

Immediately, he moved from that place without leaving any trace, and hearing what she said, he went to the pub in anger and started drinking. What she said wasn't complete, so he didn't understand it. But he clearly understood that she had been pretending to be good with him only to take something from their family.

That whole night he stayed at the pub, and only the next morning did he come home.

Samshika talked to him as if she knew nothing. But Nandhan ignored her and called Yathra.

Yathra ran and hugged him.

He looked at Yathra's face. A child's face without deceit. Realizing that Samshika's thoughts weren't in her, he felt relieved.

But he didn't have the courage to confront Samshika. He didn't want to reveal the truth to her. So he isolated himself.

Whenever Samshika tried to get close to him, he moved away. After knowing her true nature, living with her disgusted him.

As days passed like this, he also reduced going home. He didn't know then who the heir with the Surya mark of the Venthanar family was. He thought he himself was that heir. But Samshika's plan threw him into great confusion.

This situation continued for four months, and his condition worsened from drinking. That's when he got a call from his mother. With some guilt, unable to talk much, he inquired about her well-being and hung up. In his mind, thinking, "I've made my family suffer all these days, I shouldn't stay here anymore."

Thinking that, he went home, and on the way home, he saw his love-wife going into a hotel intimately with another man.

Following them without their knowledge to see who she had come here with, he faced another humiliation—both of them went into a room and locked the door. Hearing from a nearby employee that both of them come here often, with disgust, he went straight to work on canceling their marriage.

After finishing all the work, Nandhan went home in the evening. There, his darling daughter at the beginning of five years, with an innocent face, was playing with the maid.

The one who thought all these days that she needed something from their family, that's why she lied and got close to him, and otherwise was truly married to him—today, after seeing the scenes before his eyes, was shattered.

He too is a man, isn't he? How long can he endure? Today itself, deciding to end everything and go to India immediately, Nandhan made his decision.

That night, he was waiting in the hall for her arrival.

Samshika entered the house. The moment she entered, seeing Nandhan there, she was about to go inside ignoring him when he stopped her saying "Stop!"

Looking at him as if asking "What?"

"Where have you been?" he asked calmly.

"I went out shopping with my friends," she said casually, and he gave her a slap in which his five fingers were imprinted on her cheek.

"Where you were, with whom, in which hotel, how long you were... I know everything!" he said with disgust.

Angry at that, Samshika, who had been acting all these days, when she realized everything about her was known to him, her true nature emerged and she started screaming.

At that sound, the child who was playing in the room came out and saw her parents fighting.

Their fight escalated and Nandhan hit her again, and Samshika angrily was leaving the house when it happened again.

Seeing her mother leaving the house, Yathra, crying "Mommy, where are you going? Don't leave me!" ran after her. He stopped and carried her.

"Princess, from now on Mommy won't come here. We're going to town," he said and took her to the room.

This was imprinted in the child's mind: "Because her father hit her, that's why her mother left her."

Two days passed, and Samshika talked to the child and plotted to enter the house. Meeting her at school and acting as if crying, the child also believed her.

So that evening, when Yathra cried and made a scene wanting her mommy, Nandhan also called Samshika and asked her to come home.

Samshika, elated that her plan had succeeded, entered the house looking at her husband contemptuously. But there, he was ready with big papers in hand, sitting with his leg crossed, looking at her with the same elation.

Seeing the change in his face, Samshika looked at him thoughtfully. He threw the paper in his hand at her face and said, "From now on, there's no relationship between you and me. You shouldn't set foot in this house anymore," and turned to go to his room carrying his daughter.

But Samshika snapped her fingers and called him, and he stood there without turning toward her.

Opening and looking at that paper, Samshika learned that he had used money to eliminate the husband-wife relationship between them in just two days.

Now money plays everywhere, with that same money, Nandhan had obtained the divorce. Seeing that, Samshika wasn't shocked, she took it casually.

"Where are you going? This house is in my name. You're in my house and telling me to leave? First, you get out of my house!" said Samshika.

He regretted his own foolishness of buying everything in her name in his love infatuation.

Then, going to his room, taking only what was necessary for him and Yathra, not even wanting to look at her face, with his crying daughter, he left that house.

Nandhan, who left the house, made all arrangements to go to India that very day and came to India.

But when he got off here, Sarathi was waiting for him as a taxi driver.

Soon after both of them got into Sarathi's car and sat down, they lost consciousness. Taking the unconscious people, Sarathi had taken them to a small village in Madurai.

After two hours, when Nandhan opened his eyes, sitting in a majestic pose in veshti and shirt directly opposite him was Maravarman.

Seeing him, Nandhan was shocked. "Who is he? Someone who looks exactly like him," wondering, Maravarman answered without being asked.

"What, brother, is it shocking? Don't be too shocked. I'm your brother. The same brother who they said died as a child—I'm Maravarman," he said with a smile, and Nandhan was shocked.

"You're alive? Then why did you make everyone believe all these years that you died?" Nandhan asked Maran with confusion.

"That... it's some hereditary secret. Grandfather and our younger uncle said that no one should know that I'm alive. That's why I've been hiding all these years. Even though I was hiding, I was monitoring you. But what I didn't expect was you getting married," he said, slightly curling his lips.

"When a girl suddenly comes and talks to you, won't you think about whether she's good or not? You nicely got caught in the trap she spread," Varman asked irritably.

What Maran said was humiliating to Nandhan. But what he says is true, isn't it! When Samshika first talked to him, he was captivated by her beauty. Not only her beauty, but knowing she was from Tamil Nadu pleased him very much. That's why he fell in love with her, married her, and had been living with a daughter for these five years. All of that was washed away like water in this one week.

"Okay, why talk about old stories? I need you to do something for me. That's why I brought you here," said Maran.

"What help do you need from me?" asked Nandhan.

"Until I tell you, you shouldn't leave this place and go anywhere. You should stay here in my place. I'm going to our palace in your place with our daughter Yathra," said Varman.

"Why do we need to do this? Can't we both just go to our house together? Why the impersonation?" asked Nandhan.

"Look here, there are many things you don't know. The moment you go there, your wife is going to come here. You definitely can't handle her.

The wife you've seen for these five years is different. After this, only her true nature will be revealed. You definitely can't handle it, so I have to go there in your place. Until then, you have to stay here," he said, leaving Sarathi and a woman named Seetha with him for help and security. Taking Yathra, who was still in deep unconsciousness, he went to his other house. Staying there with Yathra for a month and bonding well with her, only after that did Varman go to the Venthanar palace in Nandhan's name.

Thinking about everything that happened, Nandhan thought about Samshika, who had entered his house in the name of his child's "mother." He got angry. Yet, unable to show it outside, he stayed calm for the one reason Varman had said.

For some reason, Grandfather and Varman have been silent for all these years. He stayed calm for the sole reason that it shouldn't be ruined because of him.
