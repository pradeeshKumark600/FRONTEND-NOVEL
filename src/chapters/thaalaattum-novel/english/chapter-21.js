  content: `Hearing what Perumal said, Satyavendan and Chandravendan asked their son Perumal to take care of everything at the hospital and left the hospital where Nandan had been admitted. 

The police were informed and picked up and searched for five hours around the spot where Varman was said to have fallen. No matter how hard they searched, they could not find Varman anywhere. In the end, all they got was Varman's torn shirt. 

The police also announced, "After falling down such a big hill, the child will not be alive. Your child is dead," and left. Neither of the men expected this event at all. 
Those who were worried seeing Nandan in that state, could not even imagine that Varman was not alive now. 

They could not bear the fact that the eldest heir of their house, "This is the one born to protect your dynasty", who had amazed the household, was no longer alive. 

Here in the hospital Perumal was sitting a little nervous. "Where will those who have gone find and save Varman?" He was afraid. He was thinking, "If only he comes alive, everything that has been suffered for so many years will be in vain." 

At that time, Satyavendan and Chandravendan stood in front of Perumal with tired faces. Seeing both of them, everyone got up and eagerly looked at them, seeing the confusion in their eyes and the torn clothes of Varman in their hands, everyone understood the matter. The women screamed without looking at the hospital. Even children say, “What?” Without knowing that, they cried seeing their mother crying. Deivaprakash made them all quiet by showing them children. 

At the same time, seeing that Nandan had not closed his eyes for so long, he said to the others, "Where will this man leave them?" As he was sitting holding his life in his hand, Vendanar and his wife came there after getting the information. As time passed, Nandan did not wake up. 

“If everyone is here, who will do what Varman has to do?” Deivaprakash told Mangai to stay near Nandan and took everyone home. 

Even before they reached home, the village had already assembled at Vendanar Palace. Varman was dead and everyone was doing things for him. But Varman was sitting alive next to his maternal uncle and his wife in the oldest Shiva temple in the town. 

A while back, "When Perumal got out of the car, Adikesavan took the car and had not gone a short distance. By then, he was looking thoughtfully at the phone call from his wife and was confused by what Valli said on that side. 

"What do you mean? Tell me patiently without crying. What would I think if he suddenly called me and told me to save Varuman?” he asked. 

"What, don't ask me anything now. I am now in the Shiva temple in the forest of your village. You immediately go to Kunrakkudi Murugan Temple. Varmanoda's life is in danger. Moreover, no one should ever know that he is still alive.” 

“Somehow you save Varman and bring him to my place. We will leave this town immediately. Every minute that we are in this town, our child's life and Varman's life are in danger," before she could say it fully, the phone was disconnected. 
However, Adikesavan, who did not ignore his wife's insistence, immediately took the car and left for Kunrakkudi. Adi Kesavan saw his brother on the way. 

"What is he doing here? He got out of the car saying that he had work in the garden. Where are you going in another car now?” Thinking that, he felt connected to something that his brother's actions were different from yesterday and that now his wife was saying “Varman's life is in danger”. Immediately, he secretly followed his brother. 

In pursuit of his brother, Adikesava learned what he was about to do and saved Varman just in time.

When Perumal pushed Varman down, he didn't even look to see if he fell or not. Varman's good timing was hanging in the gap, only to catch his leg on a tree branch as he fell. God had thought that his life should not end so quickly, and in those ten minutes when he was throbbing in pain, Adikesavan came there to save him. 

Immediately, he saved Varman who was hanging from the tree and the next minute left from Kunrakkudi to his wife's place. Valli stood there for a long time with his full stomach panting for them. It was only after seeing Varman come with her husband that he could breathe well. 

Adikesavan quickly approached his wife, "Valli, what is the matter? How did you know that Varman's life was in danger? What are you doing here?" He asked nervously. 

"What, I want to talk to you about something important," Valli started, then a black dragon with a man at the gate of the temple stood in front of the three of them, and the three of them started fighting. 

They say, "Snake means the army trembles." But who would not be afraid of a snake standing here as tall as a man? Even Adikesavan, not knowing what to do for a moment, stood hugging his wife and son-in-law. 

Suddenly an old man appeared from the darkness of the Shiva temple. His eyes flashed with wisdom and he smiled at the dragon. 

"Fear not! This dragon has not come to kill you. Rather, Lord Shiva has sent you to protect you and your heirs." 

“He was blessed by Lord Shiva at birth. His future is as lofty as that of Islam. He is chosen by Shiva. He has many enemies. But there is no destruction forever,” he said and smiled. 

“This dragon has come here to protect you,” he said, and the dragon disappeared. 

After thinking about something for a while, Adikesavan ordered his wife and son-in-law, "Not to go anywhere outside the temple until I come here," and left the temple. 

Even then, "What, I want to talk to you about something important. Just listen to me for a minute,” Valli said and hurried out of the temple, bypassing Siddhar who was going ahead of him. 

Someone who had already thought that Kesavan would come to see him, smiled softly at him and said, “I know why you have come to me. I will tell you only one thing. The eldest female heir of your family will come through you. If your son-in-law is an aspect of Shiva, your daughter is an aspect of Parvati. Even if their circumstances change and take them to different sides, life will bring them together. Then you will meet your daughter again. Until then your daughter cannot be seen in your eyes. Go to your birthplace now. Your father's life is swinging,” a few more things that he had not even thought of and went away with so many mysteries. 

Adikesavan was shocked when he heard what Siddhar said. His statement that the child inside his wife and his son-in-law were all aspects of Shiva made Adikesavan think. But at that time, the only thought in his mind was to protect his father. So he left that place. Little did he know that that day would be the last time he would see his wife, unborn child and son-in-law. 

At the same time, Satyavendan was performing all the rituals as a father, saying that Varman had died. It was then that he noticed that Kesavan and his father Janardhan were not there, asked his brother where they were and asked Perumal saying that he did not know either, he said “I will take care” and moved a bit to call his brother, saying that it was also switched off. 

Whoever had called him left his wife and son-in-law alone and came home to see what had happened to his father. At that time, some raiders entered the temple to find the whereabouts of Valli and kill him, when a dragon stood in front of them as their bulwark.

At the sight of the Aluyar Naga, the raiders ran away, and Valli suddenly went into labor. Valli doesn't know what to do when he, who is now in his ninth month, suddenly starts having pain. Seeing his aunt writhing in pain, little Varman doesn't know what to do. 

Varman also placed his hand on his aunt's stomach and cried, "Father, aunty, don't make them cry." 

Isn't Varman a small child, so he doesn't know what to do when he sees his aunt crying. The only thing he knows at his age is that his papa is in his aunt's womb. That was all he knew. 

Although the pain stopped for a while, the pain started again. At that time, some women from the neighboring village who had come to collect firewood in that forest heard the noise and came to see. When they arrived there, the dragon they were guarding had disappeared from the place. So when the women came to that place, they saw a little boy and a woman with a full belly. As soon as they saw it, they understood that it was labor pains and immediately thought that it would not be right to be there. They took Valli by the hand at the crossroad they had come to and when they were trying to cross the border of the town, Valli, whatever he thought in his mind, immediately took the shirt of a woman's child who was there in pain and put the shirt that Varman was wearing on the child. 

Then, he removed the heirloom of their house from his neck and placed it in his hand. All the women present noticed Valli's behavior and understood the danger for both of them. So they immediately left the place without delay and brought him to a small hospital in that town. 

In Valli's mind, there was only the thought of "somehow to save her child." 

Because only he knows who this child is important to. For that sole reason, she decided not to have her child in this town and tried to tell her husband. But Adikesavan, who did not see it at all, said that he was coming after talking to Siddha. He did not even come back to see them and forgot about the rest when he heard that his father's life was in danger.
