Sarvesh and Pranav were playing with that child there.

Truly, seeing that, for some unknown reason, Sathiya Devan couldn't stop thinking about his elder son Varma.

He was finding out just like a child.

So Mangai asked her husband, "Won't you ask our children?" Sarvesh told his mother, "Mother, don't ask that... Just the news that Varman brother has come, grandfather, who hasn't talked about anything for so long, has been talking with our brother for an hour now... so after the day brother left, today grandfather is doing well. If we ask grandfather in that good mental state, what will happen... so let's ask after grandfather and brother finish talking and come," he said.

The mother also understood that and became silent and left. The child, without knowing their talks, was running around... time was passing just watching that.

After that, more than two hours passed, and Varman was still talking with his father and coming out of that room.

After that, Varman, who came out, searched for "Where is Yathra?" for his child.

The child was playing with Pranav and Sarvesh... as soon as he came, the child ran toward him to hug him. Varman, carrying that child, turned to his father and said, "I'm leaving."

"Now? Stay a little longer, Varma. You came after so many days, it's difficult..." said Pranav's mother Pavithra.

To that, Varman said, "I have an important administrative meeting at the office tomorrow. I have to finish a file for that too. I need to finish that too. There's no other time. Otherwise, I would have taken a week off and come... that's why I have to leave now..." Varman gave an explanation.

"Okay, Varma... after going to office tomorrow, don't struggle too much... don't think there's no one in our house anymore. We're nearby..." they bid him farewell.

But all the other people had enmity or anger toward Varma, so none of them looked at Varman properly.

They didn't bid him farewell.

When Varman, carrying that child, was about to leave from here, Sarvesh stopped him. "Varma... forgive me, brother... please, what did that girl say... don't you know... you hit mother, bro? And also, I want to know what problem there was between you and your wife... that's why I'm asking... please don't take it angrily," he asked his brother honestly.

To his brother who asked like this, Varman said, "I'll tell you about that someday, Sarvesh. But now I have to go. Tomorrow morning I have to go to a very important meeting. That's why I'm leaving..." saying that, Varman was leaving.

At that time, Sarvesh asked his own brother, "Brother... you say you'll tell Sarvesh... is your son more important to you than us?" he asked.

"Ah... is he more important... right..." Varman replied sarcastically.

Seeing that, Sathiya Devan angrily said, "Varma, we raised you to keep you in the house and as a disciplined person. That's why, no matter what kind of person you are... but don't scold your wife... we won't even scold our sons-in-law normally. Even if our daughter got tainted... but what did you do to her, Varma..." he scolded angrily.

At that question, Varman looked at his daughter... that child was holding him tightly.

Since they were focused on scolding him, their gaze didn't go to the child at all.

That look was unbearable for Varman.

But like most men in the country, because he was male, the one who suppressed everything inside without becoming emotional remained silent.

Venthanar looked at Sathiya Devan and said, "Sathiya, okay, okay... don't get angry... Varma, go and come... come back..." and sent his grandson.

Varman also silently, carrying his daughter, walked away from there.

I followed my brother.

Seeing him suppress every emotion inside and go silently, my heart felt heavy.

He took the car. I stopped him again and called "Varma, two minutes."

Hearing that, he stopped there and looked at me.

I went there and said, "Brother, what is this like this? This child says in our house how we should raise children well, we raised them looking after. Hearing what this child says, what happened..." I asked.

Varman there said, "Father, I can't say anything. If you say something, I'm afraid I'll ruin our family in a situation I can't believe... that's why I'm saying," he says.

Hearing that, I said, "What happened then, Varma... did your wife really leave you?" I asked.

But to the question I asked, he replied, "What should I say... come and go." When he replied, I couldn't let it go.
