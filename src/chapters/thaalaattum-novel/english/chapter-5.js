  content: `That night, the entire Poonsolai village was calm. But only in the Venthanar family was there great commotion.

Sathiya Devan asked his father, "Father, I still don't understand. Why did Varma behave like this? What's the problem between him and his wife?"

Venthanar let out a deep sigh. "Sathiya, just knowing things from outside isn't enough. We have to know the truth inside before making a decision."

"But Father, did you hear what that girl said? Father hit mother. Isn't this very wrong?" Sarvesh interrupted.

"It's wrong, Sarvesh. But without knowing what happened before that, how can we pass judgment?" Venthanar replied.

Then Mangai came and said, "Should our granddaughter stay with us? The child will get proper care."

"That's Varma's decision. He has to decide," Venthanar said firmly.

The next morning, Varman attended a meeting at his office. But his mind wasn't there. His entire memory was revolving around yesterday's events.

When the meeting ended and he came to his room, his secretary brought a file. "Sir, documents related to this case."

Varman looked at that file. It was a divorce case. A storm hit his mind.

"Let someone else handle this. I don't want it," he said.

"But sir, it's been assigned to you. The senior partner said it's a very important case," the secretary explained.

Varman thought for a moment and said, "Okay, keep it. I'll look at it."

After she left, Varman put his head on his desk and sank into deep thought. His wife, his child, his family—everything was revolving in his mind.

Then his phone rang. It was his grandfather Venthanar.

"Varma, if you're free now, can you meet me once?" Venthanar asked.

"Grandfather, I still have some work. Can I come tomorrow?" Varman asked.

"Varma, this is very important. I need to talk about your wife and child. Please, come today itself," Venthanar insisted.

Varman thought for a moment. "Okay, Grandfather, I'll come at 6 PM," he said and put down the phone.

That evening, Varman went to his grandfather's house. Only Venthanar was in the house.

"Sit, Varma," Venthanar said.

Varman sat down. "What is it, Grandfather?"

"Varma, if I ask you, will you tell me the truth?" Venthanar asked.

"Grandfather..." Varman hesitated.

"Varma, I'm your grandfather. I'm asking for your good. Did your wife really leave you? What's the problem between you two?" Venthanar asked directly.

Varman bowed his head. Tears welled up in his eyes.

"Grandfather... I can't say," his voice trembled.

"Why, Varma? Don't you trust me?" Venthanar asked with affection.

"I trust you, Grandfather. But... I don't know what you'll think if I say this," Varman said.

"Varma, look at me," Venthanar held his shoulders and turned him toward himself. "You're my grandson. My blood. Whatever problem you have, I'll be on your side. Now tell me, what happened?"

Varman took a deep breath. "Grandfather... my wife... she..." he stopped.

"What, Varma? Speak," Venthanar encouraged.

"She deceived me, Grandfather," Varman finally said the truth.

Venthanar was shocked. "What are you saying, Varma?"

"Yes, Grandfather. She was with someone else... when I was busy at the office..." Varman struggled to breathe.

"Is that so? How do you know? Do you have evidence?" Venthanar asked.

"There is, Grandfather. I saw it with my own eyes," Varman said.

"Then what did you do?" Venthanar asked.

"I, in anger... her..." Varman stopped.

"Did you hit her?" Venthanar asked.

Varman nodded. "Yes, Grandfather. I made a mistake. But in that anger... I couldn't control myself."

"Then?" Venthanar asked.

"She left me. She left only Yathra with me and went. I don't even know where she is," Varman said.

Venthanar was silent. After a few moments, "Varma, do you truly believe there's fault in her?" he asked.

"I saw it with my own eyes, Grandfather," Varman said firmly.
