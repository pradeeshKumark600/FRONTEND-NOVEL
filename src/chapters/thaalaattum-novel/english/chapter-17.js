  content: `Night time, Varman's room was glowing in the soft light of electric lamps. Through the windows, the silver rays of the full moon filled the room. Mitrayazhini stood on the room's balcony, pondering over every incident that had happened since this morning.

This morning, she was ready to accept the groom her parents had chosen and receive the wedding necklace. When she learned it wasn't happening, her mind immediately accepted it normally. However, thinking about how not only did she marry him at first sight, but her heart also accepted him as her husband—she kept confusing her mind thinking about this.

One thing she didn't think about was Valavan's words: "I've united you with the one meant for you." If only she had thought about those words, she would have known right then that he was born for her.

As she was thinking about everything, Varman, eager to see his wife, opened the door and entered. First, he locked the door and scanned the room with his eyes, but saw only an empty room.

"Maybe she hasn't come from Pavithra's room yet," he thought and turned to leave the room again, when he spotted her on the balcony.

The white light of the full moon, the gentle pleasant breeze from the garden area caressing her hair—she stood there taking in all the beauty of the moon on her face. The rays of the full moon fell on her face, creating a divine glow. With long hair waving in the wind, with eyes reflecting the star clusters, Mitrayazhini stood motionless like a statue. In the stillness of the night, in the enchanting moonlight, she appeared like a painting to his eyes.

Mesmerized by her beauty for a moment, he then brought himself back to awareness and moved toward her, placing each step softly.

Lost in her thoughts, Mitra didn't even notice her husband standing behind her. Varman stood slowly behind her, and as her dark hair swayed in the wind and touched his face, its fragrance touched his very soul. That natural jasmine flower fragrance, her proximity, made his mind shiver. He had never felt such a fragrant sensation in his life. Forgetting himself in that fragrance, he wished that moment would stand still forever.

She had been standing lost in some thought for so long, and when she suddenly felt someone very close to her, she turned sharply. Seeing Varman standing very close behind her, she was startled for a moment and leaned back. He had bent and embraced her waist.

When he held her waist, the breeze had moved her saree aside, allowing his hand to touch her bare waist. When the warmth of his fingers touched her delicate skin, a kind of shiver spread throughout her body. Her mind, which had been confused until then, became emotional at that touch. Her soft waist fit completely within his grasp. The touch of his fingers created a new feeling within her. A thousand colors spread like a rainbow inside her. His gaze filled with love increased her shyness even more.

In that sudden touch, Mitrayazhini stood shivering as if electrified. There was a kind of tremor throughout her body. Her eyes, caught in the grip of his hands, looked at him. For a moment, both stood speechless, looking at each other. The longing in his eyes was too much for her to bear, so she closed her eyes tightly.

That silence spoke more emotions than words. Her act of closing her eyes seemed to accept his closeness. In the yearning of his many years of love, without knowing himself, Varman approached to kiss her. His eyes fixed on her lips, her lips and his lips came close to unite. The longing of many years, the yearning of many years, had been waiting for that one moment.

Their heartbeats sounded in unison. Both wished that moment would freeze forever. But to ruin that sweet moment, the door of the room where they were was knocked very forcefully.

In the closeness of love, he who had forgotten himself didn't hear the knocking on the room's door. But with the natural feeling inherent to femininity, Mitra realized herself and slowly opened her eyes, trying to gently move away from him. This action of hers brought Varman out of his trance.

Realizing his emotional action without having told her anything about himself yet, he immediately released her.

Slightly hesitant to look at her face, he attempted to say something to her. Before that, she said with some fear, "Some...one... is knock...ing... the door..." stammering, which he didn't quite understand.

While Varman was thinking that she was scared because he had approached her without her permission, the door of the room was knocked again, and only then did he understand that she was scared seeing the door being knocked. Thinking he could talk to her later, he turned and opened the door to see who it was. Pavithra was standing there anxiously.

Her anxiety itself indicated some problem, Varman understood and asked, "What happened?"

The anxiety on Pavithra's face also made Mitra, who was behind him, feel that it was some problem again.

"Brother, downstairs Yathra suddenly started acting strangely. No one can manage her. She won't even let Nandhan brother come near her. We're scared, please come down, brother," Pavithra said anxiously.

As soon as she said that, he quickly went downstairs. He knew very well whose work this was. So he quickly went down and went to Pavithra's room.

When he arrived there, everyone in the house was standing anxiously, while Sarvesh and Nandhan were holding Yathra, she was struggling in their hands. Everyone stood in fear wondering if a small child could be this violent. Pushing everyone aside, Varman approached Yathra.

Looking at Varman, Yathra kept saying, "I want my mommy... I want mommy."

"Let her go, both of you," Varman said firmly.

"Are you crazy? Right now she's not herself. Something has happened to my daughter, I'm scared," Nandhan panicked.

"I'm the one telling you to let the baby go! Let her go!" This time his voice sounded angry, and both immediately released Yathra.

As soon as they let go, the next moment she got down from the bed, pushed everyone aside, and ran out of the room quickly. Mitra came and stood in front of her.

As soon as she saw Mitra, her eyes waved, and Varman signaled Mitra with his eyes from behind Yathra to take her to the prayer room.

Understanding the message conveyed by his eyes, Mitra, unknowingly, gripped the child's hand tightly and dragged her to the prayer room.

Varman's mother and grandmother, seeing her do this, thought Mitra might do something to the child. Mangai and Mangalammaal panicked and went to stop Mitra.

"Stop right here! No one should move even one step from here. Until I come back," Varman stopped them and called Pragadeesh. "Go upstairs and lock Samshika's room so the sound doesn't reach," he said and walked in the direction Mitra had gone.

No one in the house understood how he was behaving, but they obeyed his words and stood quietly in the same place.

For Nandhan and his grandfather, one thing became very clear from Varman's actions: Samshika was the reason for Yathra's condition. Nandhan, seething with anger, struggled to control it. Noticing him, Venthanar gripped his hand tightly without anyone knowing and told him to remain calm.

"I'm scared! Please go and check. Both of them came to the hall, but we can't see them," Mangai complained to her husband.

Then Pragadeesh arrived and said, "Uncle, when I was locking their room, not only were they in the room, but someone else was also there. I couldn't understand what they were saying. But I heard them both talking."

"What are you blabbering? We were all in the hall, weren't we? How could someone else go into that room past us? Without observing anything properly, you come here and blabber! Everyone here is already scared about what's happening to the baby. With what you're saying, they'll be even more scared. Shut your mouth and stand quietly," said Sathiyan.

Then, from the direction of the prayer room, the child's screaming was heard loudly.

Everyone was shocked hearing the child's scream. Nandhan, hearing his child's cries, became distressed.
