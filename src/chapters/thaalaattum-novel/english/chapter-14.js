  content: `Varman looked at his daughter with shock as she opposed him like this.

Understanding that in the days he wasn't here, Samshika had shown her work, Varman said gently, "Look here, Yathra, Dad is telling you, from now on she is your mother."

At that moment, "Why should my daughter call strangers mother?" a man's voice angrily echoed at the doorway of the house. A smile that no one knew about came on Varman's face.

With that same smile, he turned toward the doorway, and the people in the house also turned toward the doorway at that voice.

Standing there with a face looking exactly like Varman, his face full of anger, everyone in the house froze seeing him, and Varman's mother fainted in shock and fell down.

With both having the same facial expression, Yathra didn't know which was her "Daddy." Even for a minute, even Samshika couldn't identify her husband with whom she lived, to that extent the facial similarity between the two was the same.

Those who were greatly shocked in this were Venthanar, his sons, and his grandson Varman—only these four. They weren't shocked looking at the person standing at the doorway.

The one who entered angrily inside, seeing Yathra standing there, left all his anger and hurried and embraced the child.

When suddenly embraced, the child looked at her mother a bit frightened. She was looking at the new person with shock.

Seeing the child look at her, frightened, looking at Varman who was mocking him from there, burning him with his eyes, he picked up Yathra in his hand and asked, "Pink Princess! Don't you recognize Daddy?"

Yathra, who had been frightened all this time in his father's appearance, at his call of "Pink Princess," hugged him saying "Daddy!"

She too didn't like that for a month her father wasn't calling her as usual but was calling her differently, though what does a 5-year-old child know?

At the same time, laying the fainted Mangai on the sofa there, sprinkling water, they brought her to consciousness. In a short while, she too opened her eyes and looked. When Chandra Venthan's wife Vasanthi, who was near her, seated her properly.

When fully recovered from fainting, Mangai looked at the doorway to see if what she saw was real. No one was there, so she wondered if what she saw was a dream. "Vasanthi!" When she turned calling her, Varman was standing in front of her, and opposite him, someone with his appearance was standing with the child in hand.

As soon as she saw him, with tears in her eyes, "Maran!" When Mangai called and approached the new person, as soon as he heard that name, his entire body burned with anger.

With that same anger, "I'm not Maran, I'm Nandhan!" he shouted.

At that, everyone looked at Varman shocked, while he just stood coolly. But his wife came to her senses at the new person's shout and immediately identified that the person standing in a coat suit with her husband's appearance in anger was not her husband, with slight shock looking at the new person and others alternately. Then she looked pitifully at her husband who was embracing her, like a small child stuck in an unknown place.

Seeing that, Varman felt like laughing, but considering the place, he stood quietly.

But Venthanar's wife standing there asked shocked, "What's happening here? Are you Nandhan? Then you're Maran?"

No one understood one thing: why would he come here lying by saying Nandhan when he was Maran, who hadn't come to this town for all these years and was thought to be not even alive? But one thing everyone knew well was that he was Maravarman.

Without answering what his grandmother asked, looking at the person standing in front of him glaring, Varman (Maravarman) asked somewhat mockingly, "You look very thin. Didn't anyone feed you properly?"

Handing Yathra who was in his hand to Pavithra, he asked them to go to the room.

She too looked at her two brothers with wonder and took the child and went inside, and Kavya also left.

When they entered the room, "Grandpa, who is he? You said he was dead. You even said I killed him and sent me out of this town. Now how did he come alive?" Nandha Varman asked angrily.

"How will they know if you ask them, brother?" asked Mara Varman, who had been acting as Nandha Varman all these days.

"Who's whose brother, you rascal? All these days, after kidnapping me and locking me up, you came here in my name? Don't you have shame?" Nandhan asked angrily.

Hearing what he said, the people in the house looked at both shocked.

"Don't be angry, Dad. Let's ask brother what happened," Mangai said, holding his hand, and he pushed her hand away and stood aside.

"I didn't come here to have a relationship with any of you. I came here only to take my daughter from here," said Nandhan.

"What, Raja? As soon as you came, you're saying you're leaving from here?" his grandmother said holding Nandhan's hand, and going near Maran, holding his hand, "Look here, grandchildren, I don't know what happened between you before. But from now on, for Grandfather's sake, you both must live in harmony. When you fell from the mountain as a child and we thought Maran died, we've been thinking all these years. Now he's standing alive before our eyes. Now it feels like our family is complete. Now you're saying you're leaving the house, Raja?"

When Mangalammal said with her eyes welling up, both her grandsons embraced her.

"Okay, Grandma, for your sake I agree to stay here. But one thing: he shouldn't stay in this house. If he stays here, I won't stay in this house," said Nandhan.

Everyone stood looking at each other's faces, not knowing what answer to give.

"What are you looking at? Knowing that your precious boy, after coming from abroad, kidnapped me and even acted as father with my daughter for all these days in this house. Should I stay with him?!" he said with disgust.

"What's happening here?" Sathya Venthan shouted in anger at how they were behaving.

When he shouted, for a moment Mitra was frightened and held Maran's hand tightly and looked at him with fear.

"Dad, why are you shouting now? You want to know what happened, right? I'll tell you myself," said Maran. "A month ago, he came here from abroad. When I found out he came here, I kidnapped him and locked him in a house and came to this town with Yathra. Enough?"

At that, angry Nandhan unexpectedly kicked the person standing in front of him with his leg.

In that, Maran stumbled slightly and fell down, and Mitra, who was holding his hand, also fell down when he was kicked. But when falling, she fell on the teapoy beside and got slightly injured on her forehead and blood oozed from Mitra.

Seeing Mitra who fell down, Maran panicked and held Mitra's hand and made her sit on the sofa there. Only then did he see the injury on her forehead with blood oozing.

Maran, who had been playful and patient all this time, seeing the blood on his wife's forehead, from where so much anger came no one knows, he started beating without seeing anything in anger. All this happened within the blink of an eye.

"Mara! What are you doing? Leave Nandhan!" his father and uncle tried to stop him. But they couldn't stop him even slightly, to that extent was his speed. Maran's beating left Nandhan's face full of injuries.

"Mara! What are you doing? Leave him!" Only after Venthanar said that did he leave Nandhan.

"Sathya, take Nandhan to his room," Venthanar said and sent them away, then turned toward Maran and asked with slight emphasis, "Do you know what you've done?"

"I know very well what I'm doing," Maran said angrily, and taking Mitra, who was standing there not understanding anything that was happening, frightened looking at Maran, he took her hand and left angrily from there.

With Varman suddenly getting married and coming, before that ended, Nandhan came, Maran was here all these days as Nandhan, then the fight between them—everyone had gone crazy seeing all this.

But without participating in any of this, only Samshika stood quietly. Though Maran being alive was slightly shocking to her, seeing the brothers fighting each other made her happy. Immediately thinking she should tell her father what happened here, without anyone knowing, she entered her room and called her father.

In a short while, the phone was answered from that side. "Dad, do you know what's happening here? You said 20 years ago that Mara Varman died, but that Mara Varman is standing alive here," she said. Hearing that, the person on that side was shocked for a moment.

"What are you saying? Is he alive? That's impossible. I pushed him from the mountain myself and made everyone believe all these years that his brother pushed him. Then how can he come alive? Did you check properly?"

"Dad, just now I came seeing it with my own eyes," she said with slight emphasis.

"What should I do now?" her father asked.

"Dad, whether he's alive or not, it doesn't matter to us. Because the Suriyan matcham belongs to Nandhavarman. So if we need to get what we want, we need Nandhavarman. Not Maravarman," said Samshika.

"What you're saying is right. All these years we've been waiting, and in another two months, the fruit is going to come to our hands. Until then, you watch your daughter and your husband carefully. I've been telling you again and again, don't show your character to Nandhavarman. Adjust a bit until our work is done. But you hastily showed your true character to him, and not only did he chase you out of the house, but he also divorced you," her father said angrily.

"Dad, there's no use talking about what's finished. No matter how much that Nandhan let go of my hand, Yathra is still in my hands. So it's easy to finish our work with her," said Samshika.

"Then one more important thing, Dad. That Maran has been living in this house under the name 'Nandhan' all these days. Even I couldn't identify that. Four days ago, he left saying important work, and this morning he comes and stands with a girl. Also claiming her as his wife. Until then even I couldn't truly identify that he was Maran. Only after that did my ex-husband Nandhan come into the house. Even for a moment I was shocked. 'Who is this new guy?' Then I found out he's my husband, and Maran has been living in this house saying his name all these days. Something seems wrong to me. The one who hasn't come to this town all these years and was thought to be not even alive has suddenly come, and two months before Maha Shivaratri he's come here—something seems wrong to me, Dad," she said.

"Nothing like what you're thinking will be there. Without thinking about anything, just do the work I told you correctly. I'll take care of the rest," her father said and hung up the phone.

But in Samshika's mind, Maran's sudden coming was slightly irritating. Still, after her father said that, without thinking about it, she started planning how to make Nandhan fall into her trap.

At the same time, Varman, who angrily pulled Mitra's hand and came to his room, was still walking here and there in the room with his anger not subsiding, while she stood aside looking at him with fear.

Pavithra came and stood in front of him walking here and there. "Brother, Mother is calling you and sister-in-law downstairs," she said.

"For what?" he looked at his sister not understanding.

"It's something about performing a ritual. Mother is asking you to come," said Pavithra.

"Okay," said Varman and took Mitra and came down again. There, only the women of the house were present.

"Mangai, look, grandson and granddaughter-in-law have come. Take them to the pooja room," said Mangalammal.

The people who had spoken well to him when he was Nandhan, once they knew he was Maran, no one came forward to speak to him. He too didn't take it seriously.

As his mother-in-law said, taking them both to the pooja room, Mangai made Mitra light the lamp through her.

In a short while, all the rituals were completed, and everyone was sitting in the hall, when Maran's phone rang. Taking it to see who it was, his grandfather had called.

Taking the phone and standing at a distance, he answered, and he asked him to come up to Nandhan's room.

He too said "okay" to him, and without saying anything to his mother, telling Mitra "I'll talk to Grandfather and come," he left from there.

Sathya Venthan, who took Nandhan to his room, left to see other work due to the problem that occurred at home, and his younger brother Chandra Venthan also left to see their daily work. In a short while, Venthanar came to that room, and behind him, Maran also came.

Seeing Maran, Nandhan started shouting.

"Hey! Why are you shouting unnecessarily now? Didn't I tell you not to come here now? Who asked you to come here?" Maran looked angrily at his brother.

"Why should I listen to what you say?" Nandhan flared up.

"What? Wasn't the beating you got downstairs enough?" he said, cracking his knuckles and approaching him.

"Hey! Will you both stop fighting first! How big a problem am I talking about, and you both are fighting like small children," Venthanar scolded them both, and they stood glaring at each other silently.

"Grandpa, you called me on the phone and asked me to come to India. Then why did he kidnap me? Not only did he kidnap me, but he also tied me to a madwoman there," said Nandhan.

"Hey! How dare you suddenly call that girl mad? Don't you know who she is? Even knowing, how dare you call her mad?" Maran asked angrily.

"Will you both shut your mouths now or not? If the sound you're making is heard outside, all the trouble we've taken all these days will go to waste. So will you both be quiet for a while until I speak?" said Venthanar.

"Grandfather, why are you shouting unnecessarily now? You know what? Do you know about the drama that happened downstairs? One woman would have called her father after seeing it. Do you know how you caught that Samshika mookee for your grandson?" said Maran.

"Hey! For a moment, let me speak! Don't torture me," he said unable to bear their torture.

"Okay, tell us, Grandpa. What should you say now?" said Maran.

"Look here, Nandha, everything that happened downstairs was correct. But why did you kick Maran?" he asked.

"I kicked him as punishment for what he locked me up and tortured me there. But when I thought he would fall down and break his skull, his wife standing next to him fell down and is standing with her skull broken," said Nandhan.

"Hey! Speak respectfully! She's your sister-in-law! If you speak of her as 'her' or 'that' one more time, the beating you got downstairs was less, watch out!" said Maran.

"Mara, you too be a bit patient. He kicked you innocently as a joke. That's why why did you beat him until his face swelled?" Venthanar asked.

"Look here, Grandpa, I'll do everything you say, I'll listen patiently. But if anything happens to my Bappu, I won't spare anyone, even if it's you!" he said with slight emphasis.

"Yeah, great Bappu. As if you've been cooing over her since birth. You're talking as if you saw her only four hours ago. Already you have so much affection for her?" Nandhan asked mockingly. (As if he's forgotten the beating he got from him, he's speaking like this again to get another beating.)

"I may not have seen her for all these years. But when she first came to this world, it was by my hands that I received her. For all these years without seeing her, I've kept her alive in my chest," said Maran.

After hearing what he said, Nandhan didn't say anything else. He too knew his brother was crazy about his Bappu, yet he spoke to him a bit jokingly.

"Look here, Nandha, I'm telling you again, even if you interfere in any of my matters, I won't mind, but if you do anything in my Bappu's matter, I won't see you as a brother, I'll bury you alive!" he said angrily.

"Okay, leave it, Mara. The main reason I called you both to talk is about finding your younger uncle. Your elder uncle is coming tomorrow to leave his daughter here. He just called me and asked me to keep his daughter here for a few days. I also said okay. Maran, you also watch him well. I have doubts about him too. We found out that this girl and her father are the reason for all the problems. But we don't know who her father is. We need to find him soon," said Venthanar.

"You poor things! Are you all gang thieves? I thought what happened downstairs was real seeing the fight."
