  content: `While discussing arrangements for the temple festival that would take place in another two weeks with the village elders at the temple, his phone announced its presence.

He picked it up to see who it was—it was his friend calling. After informing those with him, he moved a little distance away to answer the phone. Whatever the person on the other end said made him immediately say he would leave for Madurai and hung up the phone. He told those there, "I need to leave town immediately. It will take at least three days for me to return. Until then, if there's anything important, talk to Grandfather," he said.

"What's this, brother? You just took responsibility today, and already you're saying you need to go to town?" asked someone.

"No, sir! There's an important matter I must go there for. I'm not going there just for personal reasons—it's for the good of our village too," he said.

Hearing him say that, they agreed to let him go without saying anything else.

As soon as they agreed, he took the car at whirlwind speed and went home.

As soon as the car stopped at the palace entrance, he quickly entered the house. As he entered the hall, everyone was sitting there silently.

Just seeing that silence, Varman realized something was wrong. As he approached his family members to inquire, from upstairs, "Daddy!" his beloved daughter Yathra called out and came running.

Seeing his daughter, Varman smiled and picked her up and kissed her on the cheek. "What is it? Is my princess very happy today?" he asked.

"Yes, Daddy! Your princess is very, very happy today. Tell me why—let's see if you know?"

"I don't know. Why is my princess so happy?" he coaxed his daughter.

"Oh, come on, Daddy! Why would I be so happy? I'll be happy when I see my Mommy!" she giggled.

When she said that, he looked up at his grandfather. He too gestured with his eyes as if saying "yes." Then, from upstairs, carrying grace in her walk and arrogance, Samshika descended.

On her face was a mixture of arrogance and a victorious smile. When she met Varman's gaze, for a second, she felt satisfaction thinking that he wouldn't have expected her here and that's why there was this shock on his face.

At the same time, as soon as Yathra saw her mother, she hugged her. Samshika too embraced her and smiled at Varman. That smile had many meanings buried in it. (Him seeing her suddenly at home today was a small shock, but he had expected her next week. Because he also knew that the ticket she had booked for Sunday had been canceled. As soon as he woke up in the morning, the first news he received was that Samshika had canceled her flight ticket. So he thought she wouldn't come this week but would come next week. But now seeing her suddenly at home, he was slightly taken aback—otherwise, he wasn't that shocked that she had come here. But he pretended to be shocked at seeing her.)

Varman, still not recovered from his shock, looked at his family members once. He too noticed the unwillingness on everyone's faces when they saw her.

After a moment, Varman broke the graveyard silence that prevailed there. His eyes remained fixed on Samshika. "You... how did you come here?" His voice mixed shock and anger. (Acting, nothing else, folks.)

Yathra held Samshika's hand and stood next to her.

Samshika smiled indifferently. "My daughter brought me inside. She seems to want me." "I too can't stay without our daughter, that's why I came here," she said.

Hearing what she said, Varman began grinding his teeth in anger.

With that same anger, he looked at his grandfather. He too slowly shook his head, conveying with his eyes alone that he had no choice but to admit Samshika inside because of Yathra.

Anger boiled inside him. Not wanting to make a scene in front of Yathra, he gritted his teeth and looked at Samshika. "What do you want?" his voice came down heavily with pressure.

Samshika casually shrugged her shoulders. "What do I want, you ask? I want my daughter. I'll also stay in this house with her," she said.

"Looking at his face itself is disgusting. For Grandfather's sake, I thought I could tolerate this much, but the more I look, the more revolting it is," he thought while standing there. Meanwhile, his daughter, not understanding the war being waged between her parents, was standing there holding her mother's hand with a blooming face, happy that her mother would now be staying with them.

"Daddy, from now on, Mommy will stay with us!" said Yathra.

Suddenly thinking of something, he immediately asked his daughter, "Yathra, you like Daddy, don't you?"

"Yes, Daddy! I like you very much!" said Yathra.

"Then okay! I agree that your Mommy can stay here for your sake. But your Mommy must stay in a separate room. She shouldn't cause problems with anyone in the house. If that's the case, your Mommy can stay in this house," said Varman.

But having already told Yathra that if he said this, and that if all three stayed in one room, they would be happy together forever without separation, the child believed what she said. So Yathra asked her father to let all three stay in one room.

"Look here, dear. Your Mommy and Daddy have separated. We can't be together anymore. So your Mommy must stay in a separate room," Venthanar said in a firm voice.

As soon as he said that her Mommy and Daddy had separated, Yathra pouted her lips, ready to cry.

Samshika went to pick up Yathra to console her. Before that, Sarvesh picked up the child. "Oh dear, what happened to our little darling? Why are you crying?" he asked affectionately.

"Chittu, Mommy shouldn't stay alone. I'll stay with Mommy too," Yathra said crying.

"Yathra, dear, don't cry. Why do you want to stay with Mommy?" Sarvesh tried to console her.

Before Yathra could answer, Samshika said, "My daughter doesn't need permission from any of you to stay with me," she said angrily.

At that, Varman glared at Samshika and said, "One more time you say 'my daughter' about my daughter, I'll kill you. You have no qualification to call her your daughter. She's my daughter. I'm the one who decides where she stays and who she should be with, not you," he said with fire sparking in his eyes.

"Yathra, your Mommy must stay in a separate room, or tell her to leave the house immediately," he said.

"No, Daddy! I'll stay with Mommy. I want Mommy!" Yathra told her father with tears.

"Yathra!" There was a harshness in Varman's voice that had never been there before.

"Varma, what's this? She's a small child—are you raising your voice at her?" Sathiya Venthan looked at his son angrily.

Not taking what he said to heart at all, "I'm going out of town for three days. During that time, she must stay in Pavithra Aunty's room. Until I come back, she must stay there. Or if I hear that you stayed with your Mommy, your Daddy will forget you," he said angrily.

Seeing the harshness in Varman's voice, Yathra, who had never seen this face of her father before, froze in shock.

This was the first time her Daddy had spoken so angrily. She stood there afraid to even look at her father's face in fear.

Samshika too didn't expect this harshness from Varman. She thought that no matter what happened, he would be calm for his daughter's sake, but seeing his face act completely differently, she looked at him suspiciously.

Having said everything, he left without even looking at his daughter's face, telling everyone in general that he was going out of town for three days, and went quickly to his room. Shortly after, he came with a suitcase in hand and gave only a nod to his grandfather and left from there. Within an hour and a half, the place he arrived at was Madurai Corporation.
