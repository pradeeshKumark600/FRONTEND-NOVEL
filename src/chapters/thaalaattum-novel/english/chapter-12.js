  subtitle: "Destined Encounter",
  content: `Watching the two people seated on the wedding platform, Durga felt so much anger. Especially seeing Mathesh's smiling face made her so angry she wanted to kill him. With that same anger, "If you determine someone's life by just looking at their beauty, that life will never be good! This is just external appearance. The character inside is what guides a relationship to the end!" she said angrily and turned to her friend's side. Only then did she notice that both Mitra and Valavan were missing. With anxiety, she left that hall.

All this time, Mathesh's face which had been smiling, as if Durga's words wiped away all the smile. Noticing this, Thanuja spoke to him about various things and diverted his mind. She signaled to her mother, who also made arrangements to take the bride and groom home.

Mathesh's mother, who had been standing alone without participating in any activity there, not wanting to stand there anymore, left for home.

Here, Mitra walking wherever her feet took her, finally came and stood in front of that Shiva temple she always visited. The moment she was about to faint and fall, lacking strength in both body and mind, an iron arm caught and held her.

Looking at the girl lying like a wilted flower in his hand, "Won't this angel like a temple flower come into my life?" his mind murmured. Only after a few seconds did what his mind said reach his brain. Startled, he looked at the jasmine flower wilting in his hand.

Without his knowledge, his mind had leaned toward her. Immediately pushing away his unnecessary thoughts, he looked around. Were there others who came with this girl? Some people stood watching them curiously but didn't come close to them.

Glaring at them with his eyes, the moment he lifted the girl like a flower in his arms, suddenly the wind blew strongly, thunder rumbled, dark clouds gathered, and rain started early in the morning.

Immediately, without thinking about anything, he entered the nearby Shiva temple carrying her in his arms—Varman.

(Yes, the arms that caught and held Mitra were Varman's. The one who had been searching street by street for four days. Today, if he couldn't find his Bappu, he'd have to return to town again. In that situation, when he and Sarathi were having tea at a shop near that Shiva temple where Mitra was, seeing a woman with her back turned about to faint and fall, and a car coming from the other side, Varman dropped the tea in his hand and went at lightning speed to catch and hold her.)

Until then, Valavan, who stood aside watching everything that happened, had a slight smile on his face. That's what he thought, right! She went into the hands she was meant to join. Thinking his duty was done, Valavan felt relieved.

Yes, he knew who he was. Four months ago, when he first kept getting dreams of Varman holding Mitra, confused about what it meant, only then did he remember that locket. Immediately telling the guard there that he wanted to see his friend Nikhil, the guard was shocked.

Because he too knew that since coming to jail, he hadn't allowed anyone to visit. Only once did he meet his friends, after which he said he didn't want to meet anyone. But today, when he himself came saying he wanted to meet his friend, he was shocked.

Then he too informed Valavan's friend Nikhil of the news. Two days later, Nikhil had come to meet Valavan.

Valavan and Nikhil studied in the same college in different departments. Valavan studied Agriculture, and Nikhil studied to become a lawyer.

To his friend who came to see him, he spoke about the locket in his room and asked him to find out without anyone knowing whose it was, which town, everything. Nikhil also told Lakshmi that certain documents were needed to get Valavan out, took the locket from Valavan's room, and in a month collected all the information.

Telling Valavan everything he had collected, Valavan thought about something and said, "Don't tell anyone about this. In a few days, I'll come out myself," and sent him away.

When his sister came to call him 20 days ago, he first refused, but then thinking he should save Mitra from them and place her where she belonged, he came out of jail.

When leaving the hall, he came after Mitra thinking he should unite her with her family. But by then, she had already gone into the hands she was meant to be with.

After this, thinking whether he should stay here or not, Valavan stood there when Durga came near him anxiously.

"What? You're standing alone? Where's Mitra, uncle?" she asked with anxiety.

"Mitra is inside the temple," saying only that, he turned to leave from there.

"Saying she's inside the temple, where are you turning back to go? Come, let's go inside and see what she's doing. She shouldn't be alone now," without even asking what he was going to say, she dragged Valavan along.

Following them, the one who was anxiously wondering after his friend suddenly dropped the tea in his hand and ran.

Seeing him carry that girl in his arms and enter the temple in the blink of an eye, Sarathi was shocked.

Then, paying the shopkeeper for the tea they drank and the broken glass, he too went into that temple. Seeing the scene there, Sarathi froze.

His shock lasted only a few seconds. Immediately he quickly went near his friend.

"Hey! What are you doing?" he brought his friend back to his senses.

Until then, as if under some spell doing everything, he came to his senses only after his friend called him.

Still, without saying anything, he kept looking at "his own one! Without blinking" standing before him with tears in her eyes.

Somehow he couldn't bear to see her tears. So when he wiped her tears with his iron hand, not knowing why, her tears increased even more then.

Unable to watch that, he immediately pulled her and embraced her to his chest. Both their hearts felt as if they had found something they'd been searching for many days.

Seeing both of them standing embraced, Sarathi exclaimed "Oh no!"

"Hey! What are you doing? For four days, I wanted 'my Bappu,' saying I'll go to town with my Bappu, making me wander street by street without even letting me eat, and now what are you doing—tied the thali and standing embraced like this?" mentally washing his friend thoroughly, whether he heard it or not, Varman glared at his friend while keeping Mitra in his embrace.

Seeing him look, Sarathi softly asked, "Hey! Do you remember why you came here?"

Without answering what he asked, he took out the locket Mitra had from his pocket and gave it to him. Taking and looking at it, his face showed such happiness.

Looking at his friend's face with that same happiness, when he said 'yes' with his eyes, in joy Sarathi separated Mitra from him and embraced her. Mitra, in his embrace, blinked and turned back to look at Varman, her sudden husband burning in jealousy.

All this time, Durga, who had been watching what was happening while holding Valavan's hand, seeing Varman tie the thali to her and both of them hugging her friend, bit Valavan's hand and escaped from him, ran and came, separated Sarathi from Mitra and made him stand behind her.

"Hey! Who are you both?" she asked while glaring at both of them.

Before they could answer, Valavan who came to that place said, "They have more rights over her than us, Durga."

Varman looked at him puzzled. "I'm Mitra's friend," he said.

"Does tying the thali give them more rights than us?" Durga snapped at Valavan.

"I asked who you both are. How dare you tie the thali on her neck?" she looked angrily at Varman. Seeing that, Varman's rough lips smiled secretly and thought about what happened a while ago.

The one who carried the fainted girl into the temple, getting water from the priest there and sprinkling it on her face, in a short while her sculpted eyes slowly opened and looked at the one before her without blinking.

Then the priest asked, "How are you feeling now, ma?"

Looking at him, she nodded saying "Nothing," and he too moved away from that place.

Until then, Varman, who had been looking at her, only then saw the locket in her hand. His eyes startled and tried to take it from her hand.

She held it tightly and glared at him. Not minding that, "How did this come to you?" he asked with trembling.

The moment he first saw her, she had created turmoil in his mind. But when his 'Bappu' memory came, he immediately pushed aside his unnecessary thoughts and had carried her into the temple just to help her.

Now, seeing their family's ancestral locket in her hand, with many prayers in his mind hoping that his 'Bappu' he was searching for must be her, he looked at her to see what she would say. But before she could answer, the moon-like birthmark on her right hand itself showed who she was.

At that same time, when he asked, without her knowledge, "This is the only thing I have as my own. Those whom I thought were my family all these days aren't my family," she looked at his face with tears in her eyes. Before she could finish "I'm an orph..." he put his hand on her mouth and stopped her from speaking.

Taking the locket from her hand, "This locket isn't the only thing that's yours. From now on, this Varman also belongs only to you," he said.

Before she could think what, pulling her hand, he took her and tied the mangalsutra that was tied there for prayers around her neck.

That was when the three of them had entered the temple.

Thinking about that, his eyes unknowingly welled up slightly thinking of someone.

At that time, when Sarathi's phone rang and he answered, seeing the panic on his face, Varman asked, "What?"

With that same panicked face, "He escaped. He's gone to the palace," said Sarathi.
