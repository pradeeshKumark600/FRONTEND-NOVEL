  content: `When Mathesh's mother said that Mitra was her daughter-in-law no matter what, "Enough, Samandhi, stop! What fault did you find with my daughter?" Lakshmi asked angrily.

"What fault, you ask? Wanting to marry the groom chosen for her elder sister itself is shameful! Isn't that one reason enough to reject your younger daughter?" said Chintamani.

"Oh, is that so? So you're rejecting my daughter and trying to marry my son to this orphan who has no one?" said Lakshmi angrily.

At that, tears poured like a waterfall from Mitra's eyes, who had been watching them both with fear all this time.

Even Mathesh's mother Chintamani didn't expect these words at all. "Orphan? What does that mean...?" she thought and looked at Mitra, who was looking at her mother with tears in her eyes.

Lakshmi too, following her gaze and thinking that if she remained silent even after this, her daughter's life wouldn't go as desired, "Yes! She's standing right here. She's not our daughter. She's an orphan. Because she was an orphan with no one, we, being childless, thought of her as our daughter and raised her. Today, she's standing as an obstacle to my daughter's life. If I had known she would stand as such an obstacle, I wouldn't have agreed to raise her," she said without a bit of guilt.

Just then, Mitra's father, who came to that place hearing some commotion in the hall, heard his wife say the word "orphan."

As soon as he heard it, that man froze right there. What he hoped wouldn't happen was now happening there.

Lakshmi's fiery words thundered in Mitra's father's ears like lightning. The secret he had protected for all these years never thought it would break so blatantly. Just thinking of arranging the marriage between Mathesh and Thanuja made him feel guilty toward his eldest daughter. But he never expected his beloved daughter's birth secret itself would be revealed. He stood there like a statue. His legs refused to move as if stuck to the ground.

Mitra looked at her father. Seeing the shock and pain spread across his face broke her heart. His eyes welled up. How many times had he told Mitra, "You're the daughter dearer than my life."

But today, hearing the word "orphan" from her mother's mouth felt like it made all that affection a lie.

The commotion that happened there made everyone turn and look.

Durga and Valavan standing nearby froze in shock. Durga didn't expect this at all. But Valavan, who knew about his sister, thought something like this would definitely happen, but he never expected his sister to call her an orphan in front of so many people.

Durga boiled over. "What are you saying, Aunty? She's an orphan—what does that mean? If someone has no one, can you talk about them like this? Isn't this shameful for you?" Durga shouted furiously.

Following her, Valavan quickly went toward Lakshmi. His face showed so much anger. "Do you know what you're saying, Sister? After calling Mitra your daughter for all these years, you're hurting her with words like this today—don't you have any conscience at all?" Valavan's voice echoed through the hall. His eyes were red.

Chintamani stood there stunned.

Lakshmi was speechless, not knowing what to say. Only after Valavan shouted did she realize what she had done. She didn't speak intentionally—standing before her biological daughter's desire, nothing else was visible to her. So in a rush, she said everything, and only after saying it did she understand what she had said. Looking at her eldest daughter with some confusion, there was no expression on her face. Her mother's word "orphan" and her father's shocked pain told her everything about how true that orphan statement was.

The relatives gathered there watched what happened with disbelief and shock.

Pushing aside all her heartaches in a second, Mitra went near Mathesh's mother and said in a soft voice, "Please conduct this marriage between your son and my sister."

Seeing the determination in Mitra's eyes and noticing something on her son's face, Mathesh's mother agreed to the marriage without saying anything more after that.

Feeling sorry for what happened, she apologized to Mitra and stood aside in a corner.

As soon as she agreed to the marriage, Lakshmi, not thinking about anything else, with joy blooming on her face, immediately went to the wedding platform and hastened the wedding arrangements.

At the same time, Valavan pulled Mitra's hand aside and gave her a locket he had in his hand. "Your real mother had this in her hand when she died. At that age, not knowing what it was, I secretly took it from her hand without anyone knowing. But after reaching a certain age, I somehow kept it safe. Today I brought this in some memory. But I didn't think that after you learned all the truth, this would reach your hand, Mitra," he said.

Whether Mitra listened to what Valavan said or not, only she knew. As the time to tie the thali approached, showing no emotion on her face, she sat on the chair below the stage in bridal decoration, emotionless, watching the two people on stage with fake smiling faces.

"Is there anger on her face?" If asked, definitely not.

But! She was lifeless even while alive.

Just a while ago, those she had thought of as mother and father all these years called her an "orphan," and she collapsed at those words.

From the moment she heard the word orphan, there was no emotion on her face.

"In a little while, the moment the thali went up on her sister's neck, before leaving that hall without anyone knowing, she would have left thinking 'there's no one for me in this world, I'm an orphan.'"

Durga was angrily watching Mathesh tying the thali, so she didn't notice Mitra. But Valavan noticed. But without disturbing her, he followed her without her knowledge.

Though her mother noticed her leaving the hall, she didn't come to stop her. Thinking where would she go, she'd have to come home, she thought and went to perform the other rituals. But the one thing she never thought was that today would be the last day she'd see her.

Mitra's father had been sitting like one possessed since learning that his daughter knew all the truths.

Since Mitra's brother didn't know about the plan of mother, father, and Thanuja, thinking the auspicious time was seven o'clock, he went to call his friends. So he didn't know anything that happened in the hall.

Here, Mitra who left the hall, not even knowing where she was going, with eyes welling up, legs moved on their own. No clarity on where to go. In every step, a pain... in every breath, a cry. She didn't think of place, didn't think of direction... thought only one thing—the sudden emptiness.

On the road, the sound of moving vehicles, the screech of the wind... even with many people nearby, she felt her world was caught in darkness. Every step reminded her of the emptiness of her life.

At that time, she had no favorite place. That journey without answers to where to go, whom to seek... even while in so much pain, she didn't drop that locket in her hand. Somehow she held it thinking it shouldn't leave her. Now not just that locket, the owner of that locket also belonged only to her.

Then, due to excessive mental stress, as her head spun and she was about to fall down, a strong arm caught and held her.

The owner of that strong arm! Stood frozen looking at the lotus flower face in his hands.

Is this girl's body as soft as a temple flower?

Will it bruise if touched like a tender shoot?

As the breeze glides over the beautiful petals,

Did a thousand colors come together in her beauty!

A body like silk, a pleasure to behold,

Is she a rose petal touched by dew drops!

When walking, not even a burden to the earth,

Is she the total form of grace!

If her touch falls, the mind will swoon,

You temple flower with such softness!

"Won't this angel like a temple flower come into my life?" arose in the mind of that six-foot man.

Who could that six-foot man be?
