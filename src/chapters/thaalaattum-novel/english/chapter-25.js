  content: `"Why are you all shocked by this? It was not Nandan who pushed me off the mountain, but someone else. My petha and my mother also know who it is. Even if they know who it is, they won't tell any of you." So what does that mean? 
Varman said, looking at his mother's face, "She was so fond of him that she did not even tell the man who killed her son when she was ten months pregnant." 

Mangai was struggling to find out all the truths about her one by one, not knowing what to do. 

Vendan noticed it and said, "What Varma said is true. You know that no one has pushed Varma from the mountain. Is it so that you did not tell me about it for so long?" He asked a little angrily. 

"How can she tell me? How could she deceive us all by pretending for so many years! Two years ago, I was so shocked to see her true face. She pretended to know nothing and deceived us all. I was dying to see her. The reason why I was patient for so long was, 'You should not speak without knowing the truth.' That's right. When she knows the person who killed my boy, she shouldn't be in this house for a minute. She should be in this house or I should be in this house," shouted Satyavendan angrily. 

"Shakti, be patient. Varman didn't even tell me this for so long. Does that mean there is more to come? So, be patient. Let everything come out," he said looking at Varman. 

"Grandfather, I don't know many things either. But I think aunty wants to know everything. That's why they all killed aunty," he said, looking at his mother with disgust. 
"Everybody buy a little bit of me. I will show you directly who is the main point of all this," he said and took everyone and went straight to the room where Samshika was. 

Just then, Nandan, leaving the child in the temple, told Pavitra to see that the Yatra does not go anywhere, and hurried home from there. Just as he was coming he noticed that Varman was taking everyone to the room where Samshika was, and he followed them. 

Standing directly in front of the room where Samshika was, he told the people there to be quiet and slowly opened the door that was placed outside, he who already had the key to the room, opened it slowly and asked everyone to look inside. 

Shamshika and her father Perumal were talking earnestly there, when they heard the sound of the door being opened and got up startled. The family in front of them all stood shocked. 

Like them, everyone in the house was shocked to see Perumal there. Even Vendar did not expect this at all. 'Is he the cause of everything?' Couldn't help but shudder. 

"Machan, what are you doing here? Isn't that the room with this girl?" Chandravendan asked, "There is nothing wrong with him being in his girl's room, Sithappa," Varman said with a smile. 

"What, girl?" Mangai did not expect this. Mangai was so angry with her brother when she thought that the person who had told her everything for so many years, not only hid the existence of such a girl, but also ruined her son's life with that girl. 

"Innocent! Is this your girl? Is it unfair that you ruined my life with my boy?" Mangai slapped her brother without looking. 

"Mangai, what to do? I am your brother." 

"It was my brother, who said no? Did I listen to you all these years! But what else is hidden that I don't know? Just because I made a post and said 'okay, okay' to everything you said, my life will be ruined after all these years," cried Mangai. 

"Besides, what's the use of crying? Everything you do is a girl's thing?" Mangaiyammal scolded her daughter-in-law, "Varma, don't drag him out first. We have to know whether everything is true or not. What kind of work have you done with this family?" Mangaiyammal took everyone and came back to the hall.

After a while everyone stood in the hall and Varman started the speech. "Do you remember one day when I snuck up on you and told you to stay with your aunt?" He asked everyone in his house. 

"Yes. The person who said that he would not come the day before, came home the next morning, I remember that well," he wanted to say. 

"It's because I stayed at that house that night with my mother, look, I know the true face of this man. Because I was a little boy, I couldn't tell you about it at that time. When I was about to tell you, this man pushed me away from the mountain," he said, and began to tell what happened that night. 

"Mother suddenly became hungry at night and I was sleepless. When I got up and went out, this man came in from outside and instead of going to the room, he went straight to the store room. I also went to the same store room where he did not make a noise saying, 'Uncle is going to do some work and may show fear at night.' He was not the only one. I don't know if they passed out. I was scared and fell down. I don't know what happened there. 

Apart from that, I can't stay in that house. That's why I immediately called my uncle and came home. Even when I came home, I could not tell anyone because I was afraid of what had happened there. It was only after going to the temple that I felt the need to tell this matter that Adi uncle told me. 'Well, let's go home and tell,' I thought, and there I saw him again. When we went immediately he was not there. While I was thinking, he pushed me down from behind. But when I fell down, I saw the three madams behind me and fell down. 

That God decided that I should not die. Somehow I survived through Adi Mama. Apart from that, uncle went on a wild ride without anyone knowing. Aunty was also there. I knew as soon as I saw them that the aunt was in some fear. But, in the situation at that time, uncle did not investigate anything properly. If we had asked the aunt then, we would have known the whole truth then. But, at that time a Siddhar came there and said something and made Mama go away from there. I still don't know why my uncle left there. But, before uncle left there, suddenly some people came with knives to kill aunty. Then a dragon in that Shiva temple saved us from them. As soon as the raid went away, the aunt felt a sudden pain. Then, it was the neighboring villagers who came there to collect firewood and brought her to the hospital. 

Soon after being brought to the hospital, the aunt gave birth to a baby. I bought it in my hand. As you think, no child will die without an aunt. It's alive," . 

"Then suddenly someone came to the room where my aunt was admitted. My aunt heard her voice and sent me away from there. I don't know what happened there. The next day I got the news that my aunt and the child died. After a few days, my grandfather found me and sent me from that town to Madurai. The only thing that my aunt told me was that it was because of that Shiva temple. I also knew something about it. It has been a long time since the Agni Puja that happens to Shiva once in 50 years has to be done by our dynasty. 

What's amazing about that pooja is that only those with a good heart can perform this pooja. Even if someone wants to get the power of that pooja in a wrong way, the next moment the Shiva Naga protecting that pooja will kill them.

It is the eldest successor of this generation who has to do that puja after the grandfather. You can do that pooja. The problem here is that Nandan and I, who were twins born in the same birth, were born in the same mole. First of all, I was wondering if the puja is happening and they have planned it. But when I think about what to do because I know the truth about them, if I am not alive at that place for them, they may have performed that puja through the heir to be born to Nandan, and they may have attained all its powers. That's why they tried to kill me because they knew the truth so that I should not be alive. But what they didn't expect was that I was still alive before I died."
