  subtitle: "The Weight of Truth",
  content: `Annadurai's heart was troubled. He sensed that his daughter's sharp gaze had pierced through him, and that she had understood everything just by looking at his face. "Should I tell her the truth now? Or should I keep hiding it, even though it will destroy the little happiness she has left?" The struggle raged in his mind.

Mitra noticed the pain in his eyes. Yet, with determination to know the truth today no matter what, she kept staring at her father.

Seeing his daughter looking at him with such resolve, Annadurai decided that he could no longer keep it hidden. 'Let whatever happens happen. Let all the suffering that must come, come today and be done with,' he thought. Just as he was about to open his mouth, "Mitra!" Lakshmi's voice called out as she came to that place.

Seeing Lakshmi coming quickly, Annadurai stopped what he was about to say and looked at his wife with anxiety.

There was a certain hardness in his eyes. Lakshmi threatened her husband with her eyes alone. She made a gesture to her husband that seemed to say, 'If you open your mouth, the consequences will be severe.'

Turning to Mitra, Lakshmi said with a smile covering her entire face, "Oh my! As the wedding approaches, my daughter's face keeps getting more beautiful! She's glowing like the moon, my daughter. I'm so happy just looking at her," she said in a coaxing voice.

Affection overflowed in her voice. But only Mitra's father knew that it was all an act.

Mitra heard her mother's affectionate words and smiled slightly. Her mind, which had been troubled and somewhat heavy with various thoughts until now, seemed to melt a little in her mother's love.

Lakshmi stroked Mitra's cheeks and asked, "What's wrong, Mitra? Why do you look like this?"

Just as she was starting to say "Nothing, Mother, it's about Mathesh—", Lakshmi stopped her from speaking.

"Are you asking about the groom Mathesh? The groom is golden, Mitra. He's perfect for your character and beauty. Even if we had searched ourselves, we wouldn't have found such a groom for you. He came looking for you on his own, didn't he? I'm very happy, Mitra. Just watch—after the wedding, everyone who comes will be amazed seeing you both together as a couple," Lakshmi said with some hidden meaning. But Mitra didn't understand it. She just sat listening to everything her mother said with a smile.

"Why are you sitting so quietly? The groom is very good, and that's why we're going to marry our daughter to him," she asked her husband.

He too forced a smile on his face and nodded his head as if saying yes.

"The groom's mother was saying that he doesn't talk much. Apparently, he doesn't talk much with anyone—seems to be very shy. Even during the engagement, she said the groom didn't talk to you and felt sorry about it," Lakshmi said, as if reading the doubt in Mitra's mind, speaking to enchant her.

Lakshmi's beautiful performance made Mitra forget the questions in her mind in a second.

"Mother and Father are happy about this wedding. Is Father sad because I'm getting married and leaving this house? Is that it?" she asked herself the question and answered it herself. 'Mother and everyone in the house are happy thinking about this wedding. I'm the one who's been confused thinking various things. He must just be shy like Mother said. Everything will be fine after the wedding,' she consoled her mind.

She completely forgot all the questions she had come to ask her father. She came to the decision that she could go ahead with her marriage for the family's happiness.

That's exactly what Lakshmi wanted. Annadurai looked at his wife and sighed deeply. The burden on his heart was heavier than before. If she had come a little late, his burden would have been lifted today.

While the three of them were talking, "Sister!" a voice was heard from the doorway.

At that voice, all three were startled and turned in the direction of the voice. There stood Valavan, Lakshmi's younger brother, a sturdy dark-complexioned man with a thick beard on his face, aged thirty-two.

As soon as they saw him, different emotions came and went on all three faces.

Mitra looked at Valavan with no expression, with an emotionless face. It was unclear whether her gaze reflected past events or was merely empty.

Her father Annadurai frowned in anger as soon as he saw Valavan. His eyes reddened, looking at him with a kind of disgust. Those eyes looked at him as if looking at a criminal.

But only Lakshmi's face bloomed with joy. Her eyes welling up, "Valava! Come inside," she called him in with affection.

Valavan clearly read the emotions that came and went on everyone's faces when they saw him. Mitra's emotionless gaze, Annadurai's anger, and his sister's affection created a kind of tension in Valavan's mind, and he entered the house with a somewhat tense face.

"Hey Valava! How are you? How many years has it been since I saw you!" Lakshmi grabbed his hands and asked with tears welling up in her eyes.

Hearing her words, Annadurai's patience ran out. "Enough! Stop it, Lakshmi!" he shouted angrily. "Is he coming back from working abroad? He went to jail for murder! And you're going to ask after his welfare? First, tell him to leave my house!" he shouted angrily.

Though his uncle's words hurt him, Valavan didn't show it on his face. The pain those words caused was buried deep in his mind, which his silence revealed.

"Why are you talking like this? He's my only brother! He came for our Mitra's wedding! And you're talking to him like this?" Lakshmi angrily looked at her husband.

"I don't care what you say—he shouldn't be in this house," said Turai.

"Are you trying to send my brother away? Then you won't see me alive after that!" Lakshmi didn't threaten her husband. But the determination visible in her eyes clearly conveyed the threat behind those words.

Annadurai understood that pressure and looked at his wife, startled. She threw him a look that could kill with her eyes alone, then took her brother Valavan and went inside.

Mitra watched them go without saying anything and quietly went back to her room.

But only Annadurai's eyes welled up watching the sister and brother. Because he knew the real reason why his wife had summoned Valavan. Even knowing that, the anguish of not being able to save his daughter from that danger was clearly visible in his eyes. But Mitra, who should have found out about it, wasn't there, so what could be done?

In Poonsolai village, when Venthanar said Samshika was "former daughter-in-law," shock spread across everyone's faces.

Those who were already shocked thinking "Is she even a woman?" were left speechless when they heard she was Varman's wife.

That woman's uncivilized appearance and arrogant speech made everyone frown.

Amid this commotion, Yathra, who had been sleeping on Pavithra's shoulder, slowly rubbed her eyes and looked up. When she saw her mother standing there, such a smile appeared on her face! Wasn't she seeing her mother after many days? Immediately, still in Pavithra's arms, "Mother!" she called out to Samshika with joy overflowing.

Samshika's thoughts—that grandfather knew all the truths about her and "How will they let me enter the house now?"—were shattered in a second by Yathra's voice.

Her mind thought at lightning speed. "Aha, this voice calling 'Mother'... I've found my way inside!"

She summoned a fake smile all over her face and, acting as if she had boundless affection for her daughter, "Yathra, darling! Were you here all this time?" she approached Yathra lovingly and took her from Pavithra's arms and hugged her.

Her eyes gleamed not so much with affection for Yathra, but with satisfaction at getting the opportunity to enter the palace.

As soon as Yathra saw her mother, she fell into her false web of affection. What does a child know? If anyone speaks to them affectionately, they'll trust them. Just like that, Yathra too, not knowing her mother's true nature or why she had come there, believed her sweet words.

"Yathra... how many days you've stayed away from Mother all alone... you have no love for me at all!" she said as if her eyes were welling up.

When mother cried, immediately Yathra also said, "Mother, I wanted to see you so badly, but Father wouldn't let me see you!" and the child cried too.

"From now on, Mother can't stay away from you even for a minute!" she shed fake tears while looking sideways at Venthanar.

He too was standing there smiling inwardly, watching the drama she was performing. He already knew that according to their plan, she would definitely enter the palace. So he stood there calmly without saying anything. But others were standing there anxiously thinking that if they let her into the house, their family would definitely not be well.

"Mother! From now on, I won't stay away from you either. Come, let's go inside the house! This is Father's house. Do you know how big this house is? You can stay here too. I'll talk to Grandfather and Father, Mother. Grandfather and Father will listen to what I say," said Yathra in childlike language.

"No, dear. Your father doesn't like me. So they won't let me inside the house," Samshika cried.

Everyone clearly understood that everything she was saying was an act.

"Mother! I'll talk to Father. Come, let's go! Grandfather, Mother will stay with me from now on. I can't be separated from Mother anymore. I told you yesterday, didn't I? Father beat Mother. That's why Mother got angry and left. But now Mother has come looking for us herself. I can't stay without Mother anymore. I'll only come inside the house if Mother is there!" cried Yathra.

Everyone looked at Venthanar, not knowing what to do.

He said without any expression, "Why are you crying now, Yathra dear? You just want your mother to stay in the house, that's all. Okay, I'll let your mother stay. Stop crying and go inside the house," said Venthanar.

Everyone was shocked at what he said and looked at him. He signaled everyone with his eyes to go inside the house.

They too went inside silently without saying anything for Yathra's sake, while Venthanar alone stood at that same place.

Yathra grabbed her mother's hand and took her inside the house. As Samshika entered the house, she looked back at Varman's grandfather, who stood outside watching her, with an arrogant glance and entered.

At the same time, Varman, who was talking with village elders in the temple, received a call: "Information about the girl you're looking for has been obtained." He immediately left to see his grandfather, not knowing that a curse had come and settled in the house.
