  content: `Leaving his wife and son-in-law alone, Adikesavan rushes into the house to save his father's life, when he sees his father lying lifeless and stops at the same spot. 

For a minute he didn't know what to do. Seeing his father's condition, even his eyes were disturbed. He turned his eyes on all four sides, but not a single person was visible to his eyes. Guilty that he could not save his father despite coming so quickly, he sat down in front of his father's dead body and stared at his face. He didn't even know how long he had been sitting. As everyone in the house heard of Varman's death and was in the Vendanar palace, Janardhana's condition was still unknown to anyone there. 

Then his cell phone showed its presence to distract him from his memory. Being in the forest for so long, his cell phone did not have a tower. 
He came out of his memory at the sound of the phone ringing and it was Vendar who had called him to pick up the phone. Just then, the man who hit himself on the head 'for not telling others this news' accepted the invitation. 

"What are you asking, where are you? How many times have you tried to call your phone since morning? Your phone won't go away. Where have you been?" 

"Uncle, listen carefully to what I am saying. This is very important." 

When Kesavan said that, Vendana frowned slightly and looked around. He said. 

"Uncle, Varman is not dead as you think. He is alive. But, no one should know that he is alive. A lot of things are happening here without our knowledge. I can't tell you anything completely now," said Kesavan while he was talking, "Kesava!" A voice was heard from the door of the house. 
Shaken by it, he dropped the cell phone in his hand and it shattered. 

Perumal also did not listen to everything Adikesavan said. He heard only one last word spoken. So Perumal did not know that Varman was alive. 

Adikesavan was shocked to see Perumal standing there saying "Brother". 

He knew very well, "He who saw Varman killed must have killed his father," he came out of shock, immediately went to his brother and grabbed his shirt, "Are you a human being? Not only did you see Varman killed, but also killed my father?" He asked angrily. 

When Kesavan heard what he said, 'How did he know the truth? Even without that, he will say that I have killed my father,' said the shocked one, as if he did not know anything, "Kesava, what are you talking about? I think you are talking about something wrong," Perumal came close to him to see what had happened to his father. 

"He won't go near me. Is my father such a murderous boy? I can't even imagine. How much affection did he have for you? How could you have the heart to kill him?" 

"Kesava, don't talk like a madman. How can I try to kill our father?" 

"Don't act too much. I know all the truth. You have not been acting well since Neth. I was also watching you. I thought there was some problem. But I never thought you would go to the extent of killing Varman," while he was talking, someone hit Adikesavan from behind with an iron rod, and the next second he went unconscious. He fainted before he saw who hit him. 

When he saw his brother passed out, he was shocked and asked, "Who hit him?" When he saw the person standing there, he was even more shocked. 

"Don't do anything right?" He looked at Perumal angrily, 

"I don't know how he knew all the truth. You hit him when I was in shock after hearing everything he said. I'm sorry, I never expected this to happen."

"We have to wait. Because, that's what we are doing. When we do something, we have to do it by looking at who is by our side. Otherwise, something like this will happen and put us in front of us," he said. If you see that there is no one, I will go there immediately. 

As he moved from the spot, Vendanar's car was just right for entering the house. 

While they were talking a while back, Vendanar immediately left the place so that Kesavan's voice could not be heard from that side. 

Perumal had started his performance as soon as he saw Vendanar's car. "Daddy wake up. What's wrong with you?" He shouted and cried. 

Perumal heard the sound of crying and wanted to enter the house and was shocked to see Janardhanan lying there speechless. 
"Perumal, what's wrong?" Come near him asking, 

"Uncle, father has left us all," cried Perumal, hugging him. 

Hearing Perumal's words, he did not know what to do. Walking one by one since morning, he couldn't even think straight. Keshavan had called him some time ago and said, "Something is happening in their house without anyone's knowledge." The phone hung up before he could finish. Kesavan's phone did not pick up when he called back. That is why he left there immediately. If you come here and see, they say that Janardhana is not alive. He didn't understand what was happening. 

But one thing was clear, "Something is happening that we don't know about." Until he knew what it was, as Kesavan had said, he thought he didn't want anyone to know that Varman was alive. 

Later, Janardhanan's death was made known to everyone. In the next few hours, all the relatives arrived and the rituals began to take place one by one. 

Some people who came to the dead house said, "Kesavan and his wife are missing. I think they must have done something to him. Otherwise, how did a good man die?" They said. 

Another said, "The horoscope of the second son-in-law of his family is not good. Otherwise, would two people have died in succession in a family that was otherwise good?" Everyone said what came to their mind and said that it was true. Everything fell on Vendar's ears. However, he could not accept their offer kindly. He knew the character of both Kesavan and Valli very well. He firmly believed that they would not have done as they say. 

Mangai did not understand anything. Already, for their selfishness, they had taken the life of one of their sons and lost their father before the ordeal was over. 

All rituals completed. A week has passed since the death of Varman and Janardhanan. Still no one knows the whereabouts of Keshavan and Valli. To inquire about them, Perumal, his mother and his wife were all in the Vendanar palace. At that moment, a guard came to Vendanar's palace and told him that the police had entered the palace, and he also sent them inside with an idea. 

"The police have come," said the general to everyone, he called his sons and Perumal alone and asked, "Did you file a police complaint?" he asked. 

"No, we will not give anything," said Satyavendan and Chandravendan, who went to see Perumal. 

"I don't have any complaints either, uncle," he said. 

"No one filed a police complaint in both our houses, why have the police come here now?" He asked the three thoughtfully. 

Perumal's face turned white with fear. "Where did Keshavan tell the police about Varman?" Thinking that, the whole face started to turn in fear. 

"What, do you want to say something to the police? Have you found Kesavan and Valli?" Mangalammal asked her husband, then the police entered the house.

When they saw the police, the women stood to one side. "Sir, I am Dhenkarai Station Inspector Muthukumar." 

"Tell me brother, what are you here for?" 

"Sir, a week ago a pregnant girl died at the Dhenkarai Government Hospital. It was while we were looking for them that we heard that your relative Janardana's son Adikesavan and his wife had gone missing. We went to his house to inquire about it. They told us they were here. That's why we came here." 

"What do you mean? What happened to my daughter-in-law?" Vatukarasi came to them panicking. 

"Your daughter-in-law and the child in her womb died a week ago. Since no one there knows who they are when they die, let the people in the hospital perform all the rituals for them," he said. 

It took many days for those present to recover from the series of tragedies. In the meantime, Vendana continued his search for Varman without raising suspicion. 

At the same time, Valli and the baby in her womb died the next day when Varman, who was in the neighboring village, came to know that his "Papa" was not alive and became very quiet. As a month passed, Vendanar found Varman and came to his place, but at first refused to see him. Then he asked to say, "I have come here because of his uncle Adikesavan's wish" and after that he agreed to meet him. 

When she saw the eldest heir of their house alive again, her face was so ecstatic, "Varma, are you okay?" to ask, 

Atty did not answer him with his mouth, but only said that his head was fine. 

Even though his calmness was new, he guessed right away that “something is up”. He who thought not to hear it now, remembered what Adikesavan had said and immediately made all arrangements for his departure from here. 

"Grandfather, I will not leave here alone. All these people are going to come with me. You have to take care of everything." 

"Okay, let them come with you to help you. I will prepare everything for them to stay there," he said, and sent Varman and his family, who had been looking after him for so many days, to a village in Madurai. 

The family accompanying Varman - Mani, his wife Shanti, their children Sarathi and Sita. 

He did not say 'who tried to kill him' and 'even his mother knew it'. Yes, Varman also saw his mother see Perumal pushing him off the mountain. Somehow, he didn't feel like telling his grandfather. So he buried everything within himself. 

In the intervening days, Perumal had told Mangai everything about their father's death and Valli's death. 

A few years later, while talking to Vendanar on the phone, Vendanar said that when Valli died normally and that her child was a boy, it was not her "daddy" who died that day. When he came to know that his aunt had done something to prevent anyone from knowing that she was alive, he immediately told his grandfather about it. 

Because from what his aunt had said, her life and hers were very important to those who wanted to kill them. So they searched from then till now, hoping that if they told this to her grandfather, they would find her. As a result of their quest, Mitra also joined Varman's hand. 

Sathyavendan came to know about Mangai's truth two years ago, when he overheard Mangai talking to someone on the phone, Sathyavendan came to know that Valli was murdered and his wife had a role in it. Till today he did not know that it was Perumal who was talking on that side. From that day he could not get along with his wife. He was a little aloof from him. However, he did not tell the true face of his wife to anyone present.

That's all the flashback. No one knows all the facts. The only person who knows is Valli. Now he is also not alive. Grandfather did not know what Varman knew. What the grandfather knew was that Varman and Adikesavan's daughter's life was also in danger. This is because of the Shiva temple where only their family heirs worship, a 
Janardhanan, Vallai's death and Adikesavan's disappearance are all due to that temple. But he doesn't know who is behind it.
