  content: `Valli's only thought was to "save her child somehow." 
Adikesavan and Valli's penitent daughter was born amidst many struggles, leaving Valli in the delivery ward while everyone waited outside. 

After the birth of the child, Valli went into unconsciousness and the new born child was first given to Varman as per Valli's wish. An eight-year-old boy doesn't even know how to hold a baby. Varman carried his baby in his arms for the first time as the two women by his side told him how to hold the baby. 

He had such an ecstasy at that young age. All the way Valli was brought to the hospital, Valli told him only one thing, that he would have to take care of the baby girl who was going to be born in his womb for the rest of his life. Apart from that, she also took an oath from him that no one should know that she and the unborn child were alive. He already knew that he was going to die...though he didn't want to put up with his pain and tell the boy everything, but he matured him by telling him everything, thinking that someone with more intelligence would understand. 

The boy who had gone to the brink of death understood everything. "Even if he goes home alive, his uncle will plan to kill him again," he understood even at that young age. 

So, keeping his aunt's words in mind, he decided at that early age, "These are the only people in his life." 

But what if he made up his mind? There is a rule, isn't there? It is waiting to tear their family apart. 

The first play of fate was that Varman died while he was still alive and all the rituals were performed by his father's hands. Here is his destiny waiting to hold the next event. 

Valli woke up half an hour after the baby was born. Beside him, his son-in-law Varman was sitting on one side and his beloved daughter was fast asleep on the other side. As he thought, a female heir was born to them. He had already predicted it. However, just as he was thinking about how to save his child after this, he heard someone shouting outside. At that sound he knew who had come. 

In the same hospital Lakshmi was admitted for delivery in the bed next to Valli (Mitra's foster mother). 

When there was no one at home, the pain came and he could not stand above one level and fainted and fell down. When she fell down, Lakshmi hit her stomach and started bleeding there. The family took him to the hospital after a quarter of an hour after he fell down. The baby was stillborn after being hit in the stomach when it fell down. While Lakshmi was unconscious, her husband Annadurai, Lakshmi's mother Sundari and her son were watching to see when she would wake up. 

At that time, one of the women of the village who came in from another side of the general maternity ward, said, "Inda girl, someone has come looking for you. You can tell by looking at them, they are some kind of rowdy. I doubt it because of what you have done in the forest. Now they are making trouble by saying that they have come looking for a girl. I suspect that you are the one they are looking for." It was understood that Valli called the nurse who was examining Sundari in the bed next to him and pleaded with tears, "Please save my baby somehow ma'am." 

"What are you talking about? If you told us to save the child without saying anything, what would we think? We know very well that something is going on outside. But what can we do without knowing what the problem is?" 

Annadurai, who came near them, said, "I heard what that girl was saying. I think that they are trying to get this girl and that child to do something."

Despite all the trouble, Varman was holding the child's hand and looking at her face. He was looking at the child's face without taking his eyes off the face of the child as he knew beforehand that "If you leave her now, you will never see her again." 

Then Valavan came near him and gently touched the child's cheek to make him look like a doll. 

"Hey, that's my sin. Untouchable," said Varman, patting Valavan's hand. 

Just by his voice, I remembered that Varman was now by his side. Not knowing what to do with it, Valli said with tears in her eyes, "Varma, run away from this place as soon as possible. Don't you run away from them." 

“Aunty, I will never leave you and papa.” said stubbornly, 

"Sonna don't understand. They don't know that you are alive. You are not a little boy. You will be nine years old. Do you understand what I am saying? Please come and join you with your father. Now escape from this place," he called the woman who was there and said, "Send this one away from here without them knowing," and sent Varman with them. 

As Varman also left the place, he turned back and looked at the child's face. 

"These are the only people in his life," he thought, and in a few seconds, everything flew away from his life. 

At that time, Lakshmi, who was in the bed next to her, woke up and asked her mother, "Where is my child?" He was shouting. Hearing that, Valli immediately called Annadurai, who was there, took her child in her arms, kissed the child's face with tears and felt the pain of dying inside. We will not come and celebrate the girl as our own. From now on, she is only your daughter," said Valli, handing over her daughter. She couldn't help but think how many dreams she and her husband had for their unborn child, all shattered by that one person. 

Annadurai also asked, "What happened now?" He was startled for a minute. 

He thought, "There is some danger for them. So he will tell them to save them." But Annadurai never imagined that he would give the child in his hand and say, "This is your daughter." 

As far as that memory was concerned, it was Lakshmi's cry that brought it back. Annadurai, who looked at Valli with troubled eyes, looked at him with a feeling of gratitude, turned and approached his weeping wife, gave the child in his arms to her, and said, "Our child," said Manamarak. When he said, he thought, "Now this is his daughter". But he failed to think if his wife would think of him as a daughter after knowing all the truth. 

Whoever is not happy there, Valavan is very happy. As soon as he saw the child, who was the embodiment of beauty like the crescent moon, Valavan fell in love with him. Its tiny arms and legs and soft fluffy cheeks did something to him. Varman was upset because he had scolded him for touching the child some time ago. But "No one can say anything about her from now on. From now on she will stay in our house," Valavan was looking at the child with a full face of joy. 

Lakshmi's face was so happy after buying the baby. "Where did something happen when he fell down and something happened to his child?" The person who had been protesting for so long was so happy when he found out that nothing happened to his child and that she was fine. 

"After all, isn't it the first child? Everyone will treasure it?"

Lakshmi's mother Sundari also knew that “the child is dead”. Suddenly he saw with shock that his son-in-law had come with a child in his arms. When he came to ask something, Annadurai said to his mother-in-law with his eyes, "I will tell you later", he saw Valli, who was sitting next to his wife and caressing the baby, looking at them on the bed next to him. In his hand was Lakshmi's baby which the nurse had given him. 

He had tears in his eyes but a smile on his face. "Even if she is no more, her child will not be an orphan," the mother felt relieved. He remembered what had happened in the house since morning, and he knew from the voice that said, "It is impossible to meet her husband anymore." That is why he has shown that he decided everything immediately and implemented it. 

At that time, the person responsible for Valli's condition entered the room where Valli was. If you think it's great to have arrived, it's not. The one who has come is more dangerous than Perumal. After seeing the truth about him with her own eyes, Valli decided that it was definitely not possible for her to be alive anymore. Valli had already predicted that he would know everything about himself in an instant. But Valli didn't expect him to approach her so soon. 

Just as Valli thought, the man who had heard about Valli's labor pains and was admitted to the hospital and planned to kill Valli to take away the child who was going to be born the next moment, had changed his appearance and came there with two robbers. 

The person who came in first went near the child. "When will he come?" Valli, who had expected that, was looking at the person who had come with such murderous passion. 

"What do you want? You won't be waiting for me here?" He laughed. 

"I expected it. But what, I didn't expect you so soon," he said with a smile. 

"No need to cut words. You know why I have come here," said the person who approached Valli, went near the child and lifted the child. As soon as it was picked up, it became clear that it was not a girl, but a boy. 


"How did this happen? It's impossible!" He asked in shock. 

He smiled slightly at him, and the face of the person who saw that smile was so cruel. Annadurai could clearly see the cruelty on his face. 

He walked around for a while, thinking something, "Tell me the truth, you gave birth to a girl? Are you trying to deceive me?" He said murderously. 

Although he was a little startled by what he heard, he immediately braced himself up and said, "Don't talk unnecessarily. I am in agony because my child has died. Don't increase my suffering by talking like this," he said with a real pain on his face to part with his daughter. 

"How long have you been left alive for the sake of this child that will come through you. But how could my prediction be wrong? You should have given birth to a girl child? How come a boy child was born? That too, the child was not alive and was stillborn! How is this possible?" He mumbled something, and when no one noticed, he put the poison needle in his hand into his glucose bottle. 

The person who stayed in the room for a while said, "If he is still here after this, he will be suspected that he is not there," and immediately left the place. 

With the thought "Valli will not be alive anymore". 

Similarly, in the next five minutes after he left the room, the doctors could not save Valli even though they struggled to breathe a little bit. Even at the moment of his death, Valli died looking at his daughter and the chain of inheritance that was the memory of his son-in-law in his hand. 

At the same time, Adikesavan came to the town in search of his father, and everyone who saw him in the town came to console him saying "Varman is dead". 

He hurried to his house without noticing any of them. No matter how fast he went, there was no one in such a big house and Janardhanan was lying dead in the hall.
