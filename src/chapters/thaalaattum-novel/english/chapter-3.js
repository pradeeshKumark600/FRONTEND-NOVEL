Every corner of that house had become lively. Some women took Mitra to the room and adorned her with joy-filled excitement.

At the same time, in the room where Thanuja stayed, along with her friends, she was applying makeup to herself to the point of drowning. Somehow, today she had to surpass Mitra and make herself registered in the viewers' eyes, and her friends were also helping her to do so.

At five o'clock in the evening, the gift amounts brought by the groom's family filled all the tables. Various fruit plates, gold bangles, silk sarees—each one proclaimed the wealth and prosperity of that family.

Groom Madhesh, his father Parantaman, mother Chintamani.

At the auspicious time, Mitra, called by the family, slowly descended from her upstairs room. While some women came forward to stand beside her, at that time Thanuja, saying she would stand beside her sister, stood beside Mitra showing off the painted face she had been applying all this time.

Seeing Mitra coming down, Parantaman, Chintamani, and all the relatives praised her beauty and said she was a perfect match for Madhesh. Seeing this, Madhesh's mother had such a smile on her face. Because wasn't she the girl she had seen? Yes, Mitra was the girl chosen by Madhesh's mother Chintamani.

Having seen and befriended Mitra every Tuesday at the Murugan temple weekly, she gradually talked to her husband to make her her daughter-in-law and now had arranged even the engagement.

The Mitra-Madhesh engagement papers were read.
"Their marriage will take place next Wednesday, that is, on the fifth, on Krishna Saptami," the priest confirmed, and the elders from both families exchanged ceremonial betel leaves.

Then Mitra and Madhesh—both exchanged rings with the blessings of the elders.

There was joy on the girl's face. But the groom, without even looking at the girl's face, reluctantly put on the ring.

Like him, Mitra's father Durai (Annadurai)...
Standing in a corner by the stage, was watching his daughter's figure motionlessly.

There was no joy on his face.
What appeared in his eyes was only emptiness... truths trapped in his mind that he couldn't escape. Unable to tell it to his daughter and unable to stay normal keeping it in his mind, he was struggling.

Whether anyone noticed both their faces or not! Mitra had been noticing.

When exchanging rings, just as every girl feels inside that she wants the groom to look at her with desire, Mitra felt the same and looked up at him. Seeing that he put on the ring reluctantly without even wanting to look at her face, she noticed, what to do? This is the time telling her through their actions that they don't like her. Though one mind said it seemed wrong, another mind said no, it won't be that wrong, it just seems that way to our mind, and a voice in her mind prevented her from thinking more about it. Like that, though one mind of Mitra said it seemed wrong, another mind confused her saying it wouldn't be like that and didn't let her think more.

Mitra-Madhesh engagement ended sweetly. In another week, the wedding.

After exchanging the engagement rings, Mitra's mother
"Thanuja... take the groom and sister to eat," she said.

Thanuja, with a smile on her face,
"Come, brother-in-law..." she said, held Madhesh's hand, and took him to the eating area. Mitra followed behind, watching Madhesh's hand joined with her sister's.

At the food serving area,
Thanuja asked both of them,
"What will you eat? Sambar or more kuzhambu?"
She asked each one and served them on the plate.

Watching from a distance, "Did you see, Samandhi? How responsible my younger daughter is," Mitra's mother praised Thanuja to Madhesh's mother.

Who knows what smoke there is in that praise?

At the same time, in Poonsolai village, when everyone sat at the eating place for dinner, Varman and his daughter Yathra alone hadn't come to serve food yet. Noting this, Venthanar told his granddaughter Pavithra and asked her to call them.

In Varman's room, father and daughter, who had just woken up well from journey fatigue, were cleaning themselves and coming down when they opened the door, Pavithra stood before them.

"Brother! Grandfather asked you and baby to come down to eat," she said only that and left from there without looking up at both their faces.

She was a little angry that "Brother got married without even telling anyone."

Carrying Yathra, the one who came down set his daughter down and made her sit beside him after sitting on the chair there. When he said no, she went to her grandmother.

Yathra went to her grandmother Mangai and asked,
"Grandma, what did you make for me to eat?" with interest.

As soon as she heard the word "Grandma" in that small voice,
Dew drops fell in Mangai's eyes.

With tears in her eyes and joy on her face, Mangai embraced and lifted her granddaughter. "My dear..." she said and kissed all over her face and pampered her.

Varman was watching that without any emotion. No one else can say what he's thinking in his mind except him.

Yathra spoke not only with Mangai but with everyone there, and not only that, she called them knowing what their relationship was—that was the wonder for everyone there.

When that child spoke with everyone, the sound of her laughter echoed throughout all places in that palace. It felt like life had come to that palace only now.

Sathiya Venthan, who had been watching his granddaughter's laughter all this time, "Come here to grandfather, dear," he called affectionately, lifted his granddaughter on his lap, and fed her food from his plate. Yathra also took the food her grandfather fed without any refusal.

While feeding her food, he asked his granddaughter, "How do you already know all of us, dear?"

"I've seen all of you in photos, grandfather. Daddy showed me all your photos and told me how to call you all..." she said.

Hearing that answer, Sathiya Venthan said,
"Never mind... when he got married, he forgot us. But he didn't forget us with you, he told you about us... that much is happiness..." the pain in his words was known to everyone there.

Again to his granddaughter
"Only you and your father came to the town... where is your mother, dear?" After he asked, only then did that question arise in the minds of others there too.

At that question, Yathra...
Looked at her father.
But thinking that they won't give him food if he notices what's happening there, or for some reason, he had taken food himself and was eating.

Seeing her father eating silently, Yathra thought, "How can you eat peacefully? How will I let you?" and gave an answer no one expected to the question Sathiya Venthan asked.

"Grandfather... Mother and Father had a very big fight... Father hit Mother... so Mother angrily left me and Father and went away," she said sadly.

Hearing those words from that child's mouth... the dining table became silent for a moment.

Not only that, Grandfather, "Mother treats me with great affection... but Mother won't let Father talk to me..." she said sadly.

(The child, not knowing fully about her mother, says this based only on what she saw. The child who has seen only one face of her mother and has immense affection for her—that affection will stir up what all... who knows?)

Hearing what Yathra said, Venthanar angrily asked, "What is this, Varma? What is your daughter saying?"

The one who had been silent all this time now stopped eating and answered his question with some coldness, "I need to talk to you alone."

Understanding why Varman was talking to him like this, grandfather also stopped eating, gave Varman one look, and went to his room from there.

But our hero, as if born only to eat, ate everything his mother cooked without missing anything, and then Varman went into his grandfather's room.

As soon as Varman went inside, the one who had been silent all this time, his younger brother Sarvesh, immediately approached his brother's daughter. "Hi, I am Sarvesh," he introduced himself, extending his hand to the child. The child looked at him up and down.

Seeing this, Pranav laughed and said, "Even that child somehow knows what you're like. It's looking at you strangely even though you extended your hand. Why do you bring shame to our family like this?" and laughed.

Looking at poor Yathra, the child said! "Why are you laughing? I didn't look at him wrongly. Should I call him uncle even though he's my uncle? Or should I call him chocolate boy?" she was wondering. You're looking at him and laughing, bad boy," Yathra scolded Pranav.

Hearing that, all the youngsters laughed. Sathiya Devan called Pavithra and asked her to take the child outside and feed her, sending all the youngsters away.

After everyone left, Mangai told her husband, "I'm scared seeing what our granddaughter says."

"Mangai, father went to talk, didn't he? He'll come and tell us. Until then, be calm," he subdued his wife.

After Varman went into his grandfather's room, an hour passed and neither of them came out. Those outside were watching anxiously, not knowing what was happening inside.

What would they talk about for a whole hour?
