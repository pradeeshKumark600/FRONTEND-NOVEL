  content: `Varman brought his daughter to the room, and for a moment his sharp eyes measured that room.
Yathra, who slowly looked around the room, asked her father questions with childlike wonder, and Varman patiently told her one by one.

That house was a new world for her. Even though she had been abroad for so many years, somehow she liked this house very much the moment she saw it. So she started looking at every place without missing a spot, holding her father's hand. When signs of sleepiness appeared in her eyes within a few minutes, her father, understanding this, gently patted her, and she leaned on his chest and fell asleep within seconds...Yathra...!

He gently laid her on the bed, gave an affectionate kiss on the child's forehead without disturbing her sleep. Taking his phone, he went to the balcony in that room.

Coming to the balcony, he took his phone and called someone.

When the phone was answered from the other side, Varman asked, "Did you inquire about the person I told you about or not?"

"I've sent all the details about them to your email. Check it. Not only that, the person you mentioned has booked tickets to come to India this coming Sunday," he said as additional information.

Hearing that news, as Nandavarman hung up the phone, a villainous smile bloomed on his face.

"I was also expecting you to come to India soon," he said in an angry voice.

After standing on that balcony for a while looking out at the garden, he realized it was getting late and entered the room again.

When Varman entered the room, seeing his daughter Yathra sleeping like an angel, he revealed a charming smile—only he knows what's in his mind.

While this was happening upstairs, downstairs... Varman's mother told her husband, "What sin did we commit, that our own son got married without even telling us," and cried.

Sathiya Venthan, unable to give any answer, hugged his wife and consoled her, thinking inwardly about how his son's appearance and speech had completely changed, while everyone in the family stood silently around them. Venthanar broke that silence.

"Why this crying! Whether you have faith in your son or not! But I have full faith in my heir. My grandson will never act in a way that brings shame to this grandfather. So stop crying,
After so many years, my grandson has come home. Arrange a feast that will astonish him
We can talk about everything else later..." he told his daughter-in-law.

"Sathya, Chandra... I need to talk to you a bit. Come with me." He took both his sons with him today.

As soon as the three entered the room, Venthanar looked directly at Sathya Venthan and asked, "Do you understand anything, Sathya?"

Without hesitation, Sathiya Venthan said, "Father... I have complete faith in my son.
He definitely wouldn't have done anything wrong. I firmly believe that!"

Hearing what his son said, Venthanar smiled gently, looked carefully at both his sons, and told them certain things that shocked both of them.

"Father... what are you saying?"
Chandra Venthan asked, stuttering.

"What I'm saying is true..."
he nodded slowly.

Hearing that, even his eldest son's eyes welled up a little. When he came to ask his father something, his father interrupted him, "For whatever reason...
Until my grandson tells the truth...
No one in this house should tell anyone about this!" he said and left that room.

As soon as he left the room, both happiness and worry appeared simultaneously on the faces of the brothers, and they hugged each other, expressed their joy, and left that room.

(When Nandavarman was eight years old, unexpectedly, the death of his twin brother Maravarman occurred by his own hand.

In that shock, Nandavarman remained unconscious for a week, and he had forgotten that such an event had even happened.

Though this was somewhat frightening for those in the house, the good thing about it was that he didn't ask about his brother Maran.

Thinking that if he stayed in this town, people here would tell him about it and make him sad, his family members admitted him to a hostel and arranged everything there, including school and college.

After finishing college, when he came to his hometown, everything went well for a few days. Then during an auspicious event at home, some people deliberately spoke about him being the killer of his brother and told him everything, deeply hurting his heart. When he asked his parents if all this was true and learned that everything was indeed true, his heart ached wounded. With guilt that he had killed his own twin brother by his own hand, despite the deceased trying to stop him, saying "I won't stay here," he left for abroad. Nandavarman was 22 years old when he left this town. After all these years, he has just now come to his hometown. Let's see what's in the mind of the one who has come!)

At the same time, Madurai city,
The city of Madurai, spread out as the heart of the south, stood upright carrying an ancient beauty that captivates the mind at first sight. Chariot streets passing through temple corridors, sunlight touching temple flagpoles, pure streets, temple bell sounds—all these were mixed together in the green corners of the city.

In one of the central areas of this city, a two-story house spread out neatly. The exterior shone like a white ground, with vines around the reception door, flower garlands, beautiful rangoli at the house entrance, and pillars with bouquets in the inner entrance—seeing all these, one could immediately know that there was a celebration in that house today. Yes, the engagement of the eldest heir of this house, our heroine, was being fixed today.

From beautiful sleep, eyes slowly opened, her pure complexion, her appearance filled with natural beauty—as Lord Surya entered that room with morning greetings, in that light our heroine Mitra Yazhini shone like a moon-drenched angel.

The heroine's family
Father Annadurai, mother Lakshmi, our heroine Mitra Yazhini, younger sister Thanuja, younger brother Roshan—these are the heroine's family members.

The heroine's father owns a large department store in the city. While mother Lakshmi takes care of the home, the heroine happily does her favorite profession of teaching. Mitra's younger sister is studying in her third year of college. Her younger brother is studying in his first year of college. Mitra's soul friend Durga works in Mitra's father's store. That's all—we can learn about the others as the story progresses.

Today she has her engagement, and in another week, her wedding, so she had taken a few days off from school and slept for a long time, our heroine.

Hearing the noise of relatives downstairs reaching her room, thinking it wouldn't be good to stay in her room any longer, she entered the bathroom and soon got ready to go down after bathing.

She braided her long hair luxuriously, and the white jasmine flowers adorning it added more beauty to her dark serpentine hair. With every movement, the gentle waves of jasmine announced her beauty.
With the wet glow of having just bathed, her crystal body became more polished, glittering like a diamond shining in sunlight. The beautiful shawl she wore showed off her slender waist even more prominently, revealing all her limbs like a sculpted statue. Her eyes like lotus petals sparkled with a magnetic gaze that could enchant anyone. The gentle smile on her rose petal-like lips added more polish to her complete beauty. As she slowly descended like a beauty statue, the wind, enchanted by her beauty, embraced and gently caressed her body. All eyes that saw her stood amazed, wondering if she was a goddess or an art painting. It must be said that everyone who saw the scene of her coming like a beauty goddess froze for a moment. While everyone stood entranced, an aunt of hers approached Mitra, warded off the evil eye, and said, "Only after the bride came down does this house feel like it has wedding festivities," making the place lively.

Another person held Mitra's hand and said, "I'm sad now that I don't have another face. If only I had another son, I would have asked him to snatch you away. You look so magnificent," and lovingly pinched her cheek.

Watching this, Thanuja's face, coming from her room, clearly showed envy. Still, hiding it, she said, "What are you saying? Won't you accept me as your daughter-in-law at all! Will you only ask to snatch away my sister?" and came to that place talking.

Hearing that, the woman said, "Girl, you don't suit my house. What will I do taking a chatterbox like you? Your sister is the one suitable for my family, modest and graceful," she replied outrageously to her question.

Hearing that, everyone there laughed loudly, and angry at her sister even for that, she moved away from that place. Otherwise, she would have to openly show her anger at her sister, she thought, and left from there.

Since the engagement was in the evening, relatives were coming one by one, and the reception hall was filled with family members and became lively within a few minutes. Mitra sat on the sofa with a smile, watching them all.

Then her father came near. He sat gently near her. Looking at her face silently for a moment, then
"Mitra... do you really... truly consent to this marriage, dear?" he asked gently.

Mitra, with a small smile
"Father... how many times will you ask... I fully consent to this marriage, Father," she said.

Her mother Lakshmi, who heard that conversation from a few steps away, came from the kitchen.

"Why do you keep asking her 'consent, consent' whenever you see her? Our daughter herself said she'll marry the boy we chose, so what doubt do you have after that?" she asked with some sternness.

Without answering his wife's question, to her husband sitting silently, "They forgot to buy banana leaves, you go and buy them," she sent her husband away and gave Mitra a smile before going to the kitchen.

Though everything was going smoothly, only Mitra's mind was not at peace. She knows how much affection her father has for her.
But for the past few days, it seemed to Mitra that along with affection in his gaze, there was also a kind of guilt. Though it was slightly irritating, she let it go without thinking more. Poor thing, if only she had thought more about that irritation then...
Would she have avoided hearing words that would hurt her later? Who knows? Fate spares no one.
