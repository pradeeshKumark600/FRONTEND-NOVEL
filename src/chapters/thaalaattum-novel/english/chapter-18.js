  content: `"Everyone here is already scared about what's happening to the baby. With what you're saying, they'll be even more scared. Keep your mouth shut and stand quietly," Sathiyan said angrily.

Then, from the direction of the prayer room, the child's screaming was heard loudly, and everyone rushed toward the prayer room in shock.

Only Nandhan, hearing his child's cries, stood frozen in the same spot. Noticing him, Sarvesh, knowing his brother's state of mind, took him along to the prayer room.

As everyone approached the prayer room, Varman was coming out of the prayer room carrying Yathra, and behind him, with a slightly frightened face and trembling hands, Mitra stood holding Varman's shirt.

"Varma, what happened to the baby?" Sathiyan panicked and went near him.

"Everyone wait in the hall for a minute. I'll put Yathra in Pavithra's room and come back," he said, carrying the child, and took two steps. Then Nandhan stood in front of him with pain in his eyes and outstretched hands.

Seeing something in his face, he immediately gave Yathra into his hands, and without anyone knowing, he pressed his hand and comforted him.

Nandhan took Yathra and instead of going to the room, he laid her on the sofa in the hall and looked at Varman. That look seemed to say, "I need to know what happened to my daughter."

Understanding that, Varman asked, "Pavithra, what suddenly happened? Why was Yathra behaving like that?"

"Brother, when we went to the room, she was fine at first. After some time, she said 'I want to go to mommy, take me along.' I said 'Mommy will come soon, until then let's play,' and Kavya and I distracted her and showed her games for a while."

"Then Pragadeesh uncle gave me sister-in-law Mitra's bag from your car, saying there was some sound coming from it, and asked me to check. When I opened the bag to see what sound it was, it was something like a watch. That's where the sound was coming from. Kavya took it from me and was trying to stop the sound. Then Yathra took something from sister-in-law's bag, threw it away, and started screaming. We tried to calm her down. But as if she was scared of seeing something, she kept screaming 'I want to go to mommy, let me go,' and hearing her voice, everyone came. When Nandhan brother and Sarvesh brother tried to hold Yathra, she was just screaming to get out of the room," Pavithra told everything.

"I knew from the beginning that she didn't seem like a good person looking at her. We let her into the house just because Varma tied the wedding necklace and brought her. But letting her into the house was a mistake. She must have tried to do something to my grandchild," Mangai said angrily.

Everyone was shocked to see that the person who had joyfully performed aarti and welcomed her inside when her son said this was his wife just a while ago, was now talking as if letting her into the house was a mistake. Varman looked at his mother's face without any emotion.

"Mangai, do you know what you're saying?" Sathiyan looked at his wife angrily.

"I'm saying everything knowingly! She must have tried to do something to my grandchild. That's what Pavithra said, 'The baby was scared after taking something from her bag.' Shouldn't that be obvious?" Mangai looked at Mitra with irritation.

"Daughter-in-law, what happened to you? Do you know what you're saying? You who have never spoken harshly, are now talking like this?" Mangalammaal asked.

"Everyone, will you be quiet for a moment?" Varman's voice sounded firmly in that hall, and everyone now looked at Varman.

"What are you using to say that my wife did something to your grandchild?" Varman asked his mother with a glare.

Mangai remained silent without answering Varman. "I'm asking you, answer me. If you don't like my wife, say it directly to her face. Don't try to drive her out of the house by unnecessarily blaming her. Now what did your daughter say? That Yathra was scared after seeing something from Mitra's bag, right? Pavithra, Yathra was scared after seeing something, you said, right? That object must be in your room, go get it," he told his sister, and Pavithra also immediately rushed to her room.

Mitra was watching everything that was happening there without any emotion. Her heart felt disgusted. She had already come here with a broken heart, thinking that everyone here would be comforting to her. It seemed to her that these people were much worse than them.

Nandhan clearly understood that his mother was unnecessarily creating a problem. But he also looked at his mother suspiciously, wondering why she was saying this.

Varman's mother looked at Mitra with disgust. Not wanting to stand there anymore, she thought of going to the room she was in a while ago. Because she couldn't leave the house, not just this town.

While coming in the car, Varman had told her a few things and made her swear that she should not leave the house under any circumstances. Not only that, he had said, "The lives of those in their house are in your hands." After saying that, how could she leave? So, as she turned to go to the room, understanding her intention, he tightly held her hand to prevent her from moving anywhere.

With tearful eyes, she looked up at her husband. "It's nothing, I'm here," he comforted her, and without anyone knowing, he told his grandfather to find the other person in Samshika's room.

Venthanar had been thinking about just that, standing quietly all this time. Now that his grandson also said so, he left from that place without anyone knowing, went to his room, called Kuberan on the phone, told him everything, and said, "Quickly find out who is in that room," and came back and stood with the others.

"What, Mangai, your speech is all coming out differently. Do you remember that I'm the eldest in this house?" he asked in a majestic voice. Until then, he had been quiet.

Everyone looked at him a bit differently because he had been quiet all these days and suddenly Mangai's voice was sounding different from usual.

Then Pavithra came from her room and gave the envelope she had brought to her brother Varman, and he opened it to see what it was.

Inside were temple kumkum and Shiva's rudraksha beads. Seeing it, Varman showed it to his mother with a smile, and not only she but everyone there looked to see what it was, and seeing the kumkum and rudraksha in it, everyone looked at Mangai's face.

But Varman, at the sound that came to his phone, took it out and looked at it—his face had such radiance. The happiness of finding a treasure he had been searching for many days. He immediately called Pragadeesh softly and told him to take all the young ones and immediately go to the Shiva temple.

"Why?" Pragadeesh looked as if asking.

"Do as I say," he said, and also told him to take Nandhan and Yathra along with them.

"Grandfather, let the young ones go outside for a bit. Until then, let's talk privately," Varman said.

Understanding his intention, he nodded with a smile, and the next moment, all the young heirs of the house left the palace and went to the Shiva temple. As Pragadeesh was leaving, he told him, "Don't leave the temple under any circumstances, especially Yathra shouldn't come out," and sent them off.

Mangai, though suspicious about suddenly sending all the young ones to the temple, thought "They shouldn't know about me," and tried to approach Mitra to apologize to her. Then her eldest son came and stood in front of her, blocking her.

"The habit of blaming others hasn't left you yet, it seems," he said looking at Mangai. She was shocked hearing it.

"Varma, what are you saying?" asked Chandra Venthan, who had been standing quietly all this time.

He too didn't like some qualities of his sister-in-law. He had told his wife about it too. But now hearing what Varman said, he thought Varman definitely knows something about his sister-in-law. That's why he's asking like this.

But Mangai's husband, who should have been shocked and panicked, stood calmly without any emotion.

Mitra, Vasanthi, Prabavathi, Mangalammaal were standing there watching, not understanding anything that was happening.

"Hey, what uncle, why are you in such a hurry? It seems you also know about them," Varman looked at him sharply. He didn't give any answer. In that itself, Varman understood.

"You don't know about me fully. If they speak a little calmly and affectionately, you might believe them. But I will never believe you," he looked at his mother with disgust.

At the same time, Kuberan, who had gone to the room next to where Samshika was staying, went through the balcony and through the window of the room where Samshika was, recorded a video of those inside using a selfie stick, and sent it to Varman's phone.
