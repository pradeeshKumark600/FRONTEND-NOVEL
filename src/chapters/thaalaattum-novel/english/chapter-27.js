“Nandanoda Pontati Sita,” said Varman, drawing out every word as he looked at Nandan. 

"What, son? Hey, didn't you just tell us about the first marriage, but at least tell us about the second marriage?" Everyone in the house looked at Nandan with open mouth. 

Seeing everyone's gaze, Nandan said to Sita, who was hugging him, "What are you doing?" 

But, she said, "Machan, why did you run away from there without telling me. If you had said a word to me, I would have come with you, wouldn't I?" cry that 

"Devil, let go first!" He pushed her away from him and looked at his daughter's face. She was looking at both of them casually. Varman told her to understand everything last night. 

"Hey Nanda, what is all this?" Satyavendan asked, "Don't ask me anything. Ask your son who is going with you. He is the one who tied this thing on my head," said Nandan. 

"Dude, one more time, I will tell my father to beat you like a mother who called my mother 'Imsa'. Remember that!" The driver came there as he said. 

He smiled and said to the two who came in, "Father, this driver is my friend. I have been in his house for so many years. This is his younger sister Sita, now your second daughter-in-law." 

"Let's buy it now, it's time," he said, putting his hand on his wife's shoulder and walking forward, everyone followed him with laughter. 

Finally, Nandan went with a glimpse of Sita's happiness as Sita went happily holding her husband's hand. 

While abducting Nandan, Varman threatened him and ended his marriage with Sita. Nandan has been falling in love with her since the day of her marriage. 

After going to the temple and everyone finished the puja and came out happily, a foreign expensive car stopped in front of them. As soon as Varman and the driver saw the car, before they could find out who was inside, a bullet fired from inside the car went towards Varman. In seconds, his wife Mitra took the bullet in her stomach. 

It was all over before they could think about it. At that moment her world stopped spinning as the event unfolded before Varman's eyes, and Mitra fell unconscious on his chest as she gazed at her husband standing in shock. 

When Mitra fainted, he said, "Bapu!" He shouted in a life-melting voice that shook the place. 

Then Shamshika's boyfriend David got out of the car first. Shamshika came down behind him holding his hand. 

Everyone trembled at her and Shamshika approached them smiling at them all. 

"What? If you take me away and seal it up, can't I escape?" She smiled mockingly at Varman, then angrily said, "Well cry, I am happy to see you cry. You are the one who ruined all our plans? I will not leave you alone after this," she pointed the gun in her hand towards him again. 

To show the eye to his grandfather, he took everyone and re-entered the temple and locked the door. 

The man, who lifted his unconscious wife on his lap, looked at the driver and said, "Not a single one should be usurped from here," looking at them and approaching them, while Shamshika and Davids were surrounded by the police. 

"What do you want? It's our plan that makes you come here. You've come and trapped yourself," said Varman, smiling at them, "drag them away," telling the driver to catch Perumal and another person with him, carrying Mitra and going to the hospital. 

Here Nandan came to help the driver, who refused and told him to take everyone in the house safely, called the police and rushed to the place told by their men. 

When they reached there, Varman and Nandan never expected Perumala and another person who had been their strong side for so many days.

Because there, beside Perumal, with a grotesque face staring at himself with a frenzy, was Vatuukkarasi. 

It was Vadiukkarasi who helped Perumal all these days. Due to the absence of a mother and father since childhood, he treated his younger brother like his own child and brought him up with lots of pampering. 

When Janardhanan wanted to marry Vaduukkarasi, he said, "I will marry him only if his younger brother comes with him." Janardhanan fell in love with Vaduukkarasi as soon as he saw him, so he promised to keep Dharma with them and took them to the palace. 
All was well in the new marriage. After a few months, Vadikukarasi let it be that Dharman's attitude was different and asked his tamayan what it was, and that it would not be a big problem as he did not say anything. 

Just then, as was their custom in Vendanar's dynasty, their eldest heir Vendanar and his wife went to perform puja in the Shiva temple, and Dharma followed behind them without their knowledge. 

In the town, all these people told Dharma, "If one attains that power, there is no one in this world who can defeat him," saying that this was it, to stimulate his desire, and with the aim of attaining it, he joined with some miscreants and entered the temple to attain that power. All that said left it unsaid, "If you enter that temple with evil intentions, it is difficult to come out alive." 

So the one who went in, not only saw both of them doing the pooja, but at the end of the pooja, when he came close to the glowing Agni Sathi, the guarding dragon touched him, and the next moment his whole body was poisoned and his body turned blue. 

The two who had come to perform the puja after hearing about the snake that was already here came in with fear. So their eyes were closed so they didn't see anything that happened there. Dharmana opened her eyes only to scream at the snakebite, where the huge snake spewed its venom on Dharmana and re-entered the womb. 

That day 'Dharman's death' was the headline in the whole town. Vaduukkarasi, who kept his brother's life alive, said, "The power that took the life of his brother, he should rule that power." 

Valli was the first to know the truth about him. When Varman came to know about their affair, Valli was caught by Vaduukkarasi before he could escape after hearing what Varman was saying over the phone asking him to kill him. 

"Nobody should be alive if I don't know anything about me," he told Adikesavan to save Varman before approaching Valli, holding Vatudiukkarasi and throwing him down. 

No matter how much Valli tried to tell this to Vendanar, he was unable to tell it till the end. 
Then, Janardhanan came to stop the person who wanted to go quickly, asking that Valli had labor pains and was admitted to the hospital. 

"Queen, what have you done? Do you know? Everything you have done is a sin. Please leave our daughter-in-law. Don't do anything to her," she begged, and without the least bit of mercy, she had injected her husband with the poison that was to be given to Valli. 

He went to the hospital after taking another poison injection. In order to prevent the deceased from having a daughter as the eldest heir of their house, he killed Valli in a fit of rage and attended Varman's funeral 'as if he knew nothing'. As he was showing his normal face everywhere, no one suspected him. Why, even Mangai doesn't know that her mother did it all. 

Varman and Nandan followed Perumal and Vadikukarasi to take them away. After going to the police station, when Varman heard him say everything he had done, he did not know what to think. 

A few hours later, after a long time in the hospital, Mitra woke up with her entire family standing in front of her. But, not seeing her husband alone, Varman entered, looking round and round.

When he entered and saw his wife awake, he rushed without noticing anyone there and hugged his wife with tears in his eyes. 

"Well, I've got nothing," he said, laughing, "do you know that for a minute my life is gone?" He said in a hoarse voice. 

"Where did your life go, uncle?" Sita asked the ignorant child, at which everyone laughed. 

"Ask your husband. He'll tell you where he is," he said, turning her to him, "Why, drag me away?" Nandan looked at him like that. 

"Machan, what is Uncle Verma saying? Where did he die?" asked in a whispering voice, and there was a pattern of it in her whispering voice. "I see, this is a hospital, right? I don't know what I'm going to do with you," said Varman, pulling her out, followed by the others, and stopped them all. 

"A surprise for all of you. I told you, didn't I? That surprise," said an old man, showing the gate and standing there, skin and bones. No one recognized him there. Such was his appearance. 

"Verma, who is this?" Vendar asked first. When Varman got up from his wife, he went near him and took him by the hand and said, "This is my first uncle to everyone. Mitra's true father," and everyone's face was so happy. 

Why, not even Mitra expected this. 
"Varma, my daughter," asked Kesavan, and Varman took him to Mitra's compartment. 

Adikesavan hugged his daughter and called Mitra, "Father," with wide eyes. 

Kesavan was happy to be alive, and everyone was doubly happy when Mitra found out that Kesavan was a girl. 

It has been 20 days since Mitra was brought home from the hospital. Today is the Maha Shivratri said by Vendar. Varman and his wife would finish the night puja and come home only in the morning. All preparations were going on for that. 

No one talks to Mangai. He also started living accepting it saying, 'This is his punishment.' 

At the same time, here in Madurai, "Why did we come home?" Tanuja gives me the idea every day. What his mother said that day was true. Mathesh found out within a week of his marriage that he had rejected gold as tin and made tin his wife. 

However, 'this is his life', he accepts it and lives with pride. It is the same today. In the morning, when she asked her to cook because her mother was not feeling well, she said, "She can't cook everything. If you want, I will order from the hotel." 

Chintamani looked at her son and said, "You need this," and went to his room. 

"Forgive me, Mathesh. I thought it was family honor and I married this girl to you by marrying you and ruining your life," said his father. 

"Excuse me, all this is written in my head. What can I do?" After saying that, Mathesh went to his office. 

At the same time, Annadurai Lakshmi also broke down hearing that Roshan said that his sister had gone somewhere. Even though he betrayed Mitra with affection for his own daughter, he had more affection for her as 'the first child'. 

But when Tanuja threatened to stay, that's why both of them agreed to the marriage. But now when Mithrayazini said that she will not come here anymore, both of them broke down. 

After going straight to Durga and getting Mitra's address, the three of them came towards Pooncholai village in a week. Unexpectedly, the car they came in met with an accident and Annadurai and Lakshmi died on the spot. 

Roshan, who was hit only on the head, was taken to the hospital and Roshan called Mitra from the phone, which was picked up by Varman. Those who told all that had happened, Varman told the people in his house not to tell Mitra about this now, "to buy Padi," and he himself came to Madurai and performed all the rituals for Annadurai and Lakshmi.

Valavan asks about Mitra's arrival and tells her what happened and says she still doesn't know. After asking Roshan to take care of Valavan, he came to Pooncholai. 

Later, only after Mitra recovered well, she was told about the death of both Annadurai and Lakshmi. 

Mitra was saddened that she could not even go to the funeral of those who raised her as 'mother and father' for so many years. Amidst this, Valavan and Durga come and see Mitra after Roshan recovers and takes him along. 

Behold, both the husband and wife have left for the Shiva temple. Both husband and wife entered the dilapidated Shiva temple alone in the dark forest, holding hands, where snakes were everywhere. Lo and behold, with all the holy conch, holy water, and the holy flower suitable for Shiva, they performed the puja from the house to Shiva's lingam. 

Puja was performed throughout the night and as a result, Agni Chuli appeared on the lingam and blessed both the husband and wife. After all the pooja was completed, both the husband and wife journeyed home with contentment. 

Sita was standing at the door of the house with aarti for them. 

"Andi, the aarti is taken away only after they come. Why are you standing on the door step with the aarti in your hand since morning?" Nandan who came near her asked, 

"Oh machan, you don't know anything. If you take aarti, put a lot of money. No matter where in our town, wherever aarti is performed, I will stand in the front. Only now, if I didn't come in front, what will I do if someone else takes aarti and buys money?" Nandan looked at her and patted her on the head, saying with the village's pride. 

While he was lamenting that "Vechu has put this madness on my head and wasted my life," his beloved daughter Yatra came there with aarti in her hand, calling him "Daddy". 

Nandan thought, "Lord! My daughter has become like her now that she has come together." 

"Pilgrim boy, what gold is this?" 

"Father, only Seethamma and Varma are taking aarti for father. Shouldn't I take it? I will also take it for my father," he said looking at Sita's face and saying, 

"Hey, here is Barudi Silvandu! I will perform aarti for my uncle and sister first. If you want it, you can go and get it. Have you come..." to smile. 

Seeing both of them, everyone in the house hit their heads. 

Without keeping them waiting for a long time, both the husband and wife got out of the car with so much happiness on their faces, "Sir.., uncle and sister are here!" Sita screamed, 

In which all came to the gate. 
"Uncle, I will perform aarti for you first. Then you have to pay me a lot of money, okay?" Saying that, Aarti went around and stood before Varman with outstretched hand, 

"Dad, you don't have to give them first, I want to give it to you," Pushing Sita away, she wrapped her pinched hands around her 'Varma Dad', 'Mitra Amma', took the plate from her hand and handed it to her younger sister Pavitra, who carried her in his arms, Varman kissed her on the cheek, and to see his friend Sarathi, ten 500 rupee notes each. Varman divided it equally and gave it to both. Carrying the Yatra, he entered the house. 

"Owner of such a great empire, can you go and fight for money like this?" To tease both the drivers, 

"Boda dubku!" That Yatra would knock him down on one side and his younger sister Sita on the other side, and the place was lively. 

I wish them all the same happiness and farewell, thank you and hello🙏🙏🙏.
